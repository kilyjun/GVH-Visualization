 [Flash back on GVH Bursary Award Ceremony 2019 and Our Current Timeline] Last year, we arrived in Yangon on 21 May 2019 to do some last minute preparations like writing donors' messages on custom-designed notebooks and packing prizes for bursary awardees before the actual bursary award ceremony on 23 May 2019. After the ceremony, we went on a 16-hour journey to our favourite mountain-top village of Zuitui in Chin State for a 3-day exploration and we even discovered an isolated waterfall then! In the blink of an eye, it's now May 2020. Although there won't be any formal ceremony happening this round, our goal of supporting disadvantaged students in their educational journey continues. Today, 6 May 2020 is the due date for children homes to send in their bursary applications. Interview and selection testing will commence on 8 May 2020 and expected to end on 13 May 2020. We will spend the following few days to collate and finalise the scores and the winners will be announced later in the month before 31 May 2020. We will share our updates on this page a step at a time so that you could also journey together with us as we progress along.

 [Flash back on GVH Bursary Award Ceremony 2019 and Our Current Timeline]
 

 For the 1st time in 5 years, we will be receiving application for this year's Bursary Award online using Google Form and do away with the need for paper application. Children who are studying in grade 9, 10 and 11 in 2020/2021 academic year from 18 of GVH sponsored children homes and a local village cluster are invited to apply for this award. This is also the 1st year we extend the Bursary support to promising children who live with their parents in the village, who show exceptional dedication in their studies but whose parents have financial difficulty supporting their high school educational needs. As this is a pilot initiative, we target to offer 2 of the 60 places to these children living with parents. After 1 year of support, we will assess again if we could help more children staying with parents in villages from next year onwards. As of this message, we have reached 21.89% of our fund raising campaign. Please see this link for more details of our Bursary Program. https://www.facebook.com/375770749282695/posts/1318118915047869/ We will share more updates soon!

 Calling for financial assistance for the 5th GVH Bursary Project and Purchase of School Uniform & Study Material for 400 children for 2020/2021 academic year!
 

 *Funds required and status of fund raised below*
 

 New academic year in Myanmar starts in June 2020. Last year, with your support, GVH was able to supply educational necessities like assessment books, stationery, school bags and writing material to 300 children from various homes and orphanages. We were also able to sponsor 40 promising children tuition fees for a year so that they could have a higher chance to eventually pass their high school exam and qualify for university entrance.
 

 This year, we target to offer bursary award to 60 children who have shown tremendous dedication and drive in their studies but was unable to attend tuition classes due to financial constraint of their foster homes.
 

 We also target to provide 1 school uniform per child and all essential educational materials for 400 children in 21 homes and small villages we adopted over the years.
 

 In 2018, our 2018 Bursary Award ceremony was feaatured on ""Our Better World"" their short documentary. Have a look at it here!

 -----Background Information ----
 In Myanmar, education in public schools is free. However children are required to be in their school uniforms and have their own study material before they are allowed and ready to attend the classes. Between July and November during the rainy season, it is common to see children wearing wet uniform to school in the rural community as they may only have 1 set of uniform for the whole year. Due to limited capital, many foster homes we know could hardly afford to purchase more school uniforms for the children they take care of. Some children wear old uniforms which were passed down from the elder children which usually are not in good condition.
 

 The culture of education in Myanmar is such that students have the mentality that passing the Grade 11 high school exam is their golden ticket to greater success in life. Yet the passing rate in Myanmar remains low (about 20 - 30%), not to mention the passing rate among disadvantaged children in homes and orphanages who could not afford to hire tutors or attend tuition classes.
 

 ----- How much is it -----
 Estimated price as it differs at different region
 

 1 set of uniform per year (Younger Learner): S$6.30
 1 set of uniform per year (Teenage Learner): S$8.50
 

 To cater to 1 child, 1 whole year of educational material (like exercise books and writing material): S$12 per child per year.
 

 Tuition fees
 - In large group classes
 - attend class every day after school
 - hours per days varies, about 6 hours a day on weekends and 4 hours a day on weekdays.
 

 Grade 11 (most important year): S$60.00/mth
 Grade 9 and 10: S$50.00/mth
 

 *Note that price stated may vary and we are taking into consideration that the Myanmar currency will continue to strengthen in 2020.
 

 ----- The Uniform Plan -----
 (Target: S$2960 for 400 uniform)
 

 This is calculated based on an average of $7.40 per child. Once again, price may vary and depend on exchange rate.
 

 ---- The Educational Material Plan ----
 (Target: S$4800 for 400 sets)
 

 This is calculated based on $12 worth of exercise books, pens, pencils, erasers, textbooks etc) per child per year.
 

 (Average of $1 per child per month)
 

 ----- The Bursary Plan -----
 (Target: S$33,000 to sponsor 60 children for 1 year tuition fee)
 

 This amount is calculated based on S$55 per month per child over an academic year of 10 months.
 

 There are 2 categories this year
 

 C1) Grade 11 (Final Year)
 C2) Grade 9 and 10 (High School)
 

 We will invite all children studying in these 3 grades in our umbrella of care to apply for the award. We will assess them based on
 

 1) Behavior
 2) Testimonials and Recommendation
 3) English Essay and Oral Test
 4) Current School Results
 

 Winner of the award will be presented with a full year sponsorship of their tuition fees, full year supply of books, stationery and other essential needs to aid in their education.
 

 By our discretion (and available funds), we will offer partial support of tuition fees to those who missed out the bursary award silghtly..
 

 We aim to support at least 60 children one full tuition fee sponsorship this year.
 

 ** Do also note that we do not award cash to the bursary award winners like what we do in Singapore. We pay fees to the education providers and material suppliers directly monthly. This ensures that the money is used for its intended purpose, which is to send the children to attend classes. *
 

 ----- The Simple Award Presentation -----
 Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, we will not be organising the Bursary award ceremony on 20 May 2020 to prevent mass gathering of children. We will, however, be presenting the Certificate of Achievement to the Bursary winners and Certificate of Excellence to outstanding students in June 2020 (or the date of school re-open this year) to congratulate them. More detail on this will be announced on a later date. 
 

 As such, we will not be raising funds for the ceremony this year.
 

 ----- Time Line -----
 By 20 May 2020, we will announce whether we are financially capable to purchase 400 sets of uniform, 450 sets of educational materials and support 60 children for 1 year of education. So this is currently the 1st deadline.
 

 We will announce the result of the bursary by 31 May 2020.
 

 School and tuition program will officially start first week of June 2020.
 

 On a monthly basis, our Bursary Fund will pay for monthly tuition fees that the children will be attending all the way till the end of the academic year in March 2021. 
 

 ----- Transparency -----
 We will update our Facebook page of the status of our fund raising including the names (or alias if preferred to stay anonymous) of donors who have pledge their support.

  We have just started the planning stage for the 5th run of GVH Bursary Project last weekend! The '5th GVH Bursary Committee' will be led by Linus, Joseph, Boon Han and Farid and our objective for this year is to support 450 children (up from 300 last run) and present 60 bursary award (up from 40 last run) to children in rural part of Myanmar. One of the main challenges we are facing right now is the current COVID-19 pandemic. We have originally scheduled the Bursary Award ceremony to be held on 20 May 2020 (1 month from today) to gather the bursary winners and excellence award winners at a centralised location in Yangon such as the National Museum function room. However in view of the current pandemic, we are making changes to this plan. One idea is to move the ceremony to a LIVE online one which might be challenging as most children and children homes do not have stable internet access. Other ideas include postponing the ceremony to after the pandemic or to do small prize presentation in the individual children homes while we record the speeches of the children instead. The pandemic will also affect our selection and interviewing process as we aim to minimise face to face contact with the children at this point in time. We will be depending on the technology available to us to achieve this in May 2020. We will continue to assess the pandemic situation and come out with the best alternative for the children. The next academic year starts in June 2020 and ends in March 2021. This project will include - Providing school uniform for every child - Supplying educational materials like books, stationery to every child - Sponsoring tuition fees to the most promising ones among the children. Unused funds from the fund raising effort of this year's GVH Education Camp (which was replaced by COVID-19 Awareness Workshop) will be brought forward into funding this Bursary Project. We will be reporting on this soon. Most importantly, our objective is fixed - to support the children in their educational journey for the betterment of their lives so that in times to come, they can support their family and community and inspire more children in the villages to also excel in their educational pursuit. We cast our goal in stone but we write our plans on sand. We will adjust our plans accordingly to move towards our goal a step at a time. We will be posting more updates about this project very soon!

 Thank you if you have read till this point.
 

 GVH believes that education can change lives for the better. This is why we allocate substantial resources on sponsoring children to achieve better results in school and develop skills with value.

7,2020,GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative,Necessities,Rice for Hope,"GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 65th month since Nov 2014!
 

 In Apr 2020, 51 sacks of rice were distributed to 23 homes for children and widows. This includes 1 new home known as Future Star Shelter.
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Apr 2020.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 3 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 3 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 2 sacks
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks
 Widow Home: 2 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 3 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks
 Abundant Life Home: 1 sack
 Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks
 Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks
 Faith Home: 2 sacks
 Noble Home: 2 sacks
 Canaan Home: 3 sacks

 New Hope Home: 3 sacks
 Bethel-II Children Home: 0 sack
 Grace Care Children Home: 1 sacks
 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 2 sacks
 Victory Children Home: 2 sacks
 New Life Children Home: 2 sacks 
 Future Star Shelter: 4 sacks
 

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 2178 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 202 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 207 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 189 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 148 sacks
 Faith Home: 132 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 89 sacks
 Boarding School: 2 sacks

 Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks
 Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015)
 Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes)
 Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019)
 

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.","Crown Orphanage

  The 6th way, is to help boost immunity in the body of the children and widows. They have been advised to take a Vitamin C pill everyday, 2 hours after breakfast. We thank Faith Children Home for sharing this video with us and ensuring that every child has taken their vitamins diligently.

 The 5th way, is to do regular temperature taking at least twice a day so that any symptom of fever can be detected quickly and medical attention can be sought immediately. We also encourage every child to record their temperature reading in a log book for future reference and as far as possible, not to share thermometer for hygiene purpose. 6 days after our workshop, no child has reported any sign of fever.

 The 4th way, is to educate our children so that they understood the 'Why's and 'How's of COVID-19 Prevention and not just the 'What's they need to do. And to handhold them step by step and day after day in building new habits to safeguard themselves. 
 

 We appreciate the meticulous efforts of the caregivers of various children home to transfer what they have learnt on 1 April 2020 to the children they are taking care of at their individual homes.

 Today, 2 April 2020, caregivers from various homes started transferring knowledge to their children about COVID-19 virus and what they can do to reduce the chance of an infection. One way, is to thoroughly wash their hands.

 The 3rd way, is to observe physical distancing while having a meal together. The children are encouraged to not share food with one another and to thoroughly clean their utensils and plates with detergent before and after use. When there is a need to scoop soup from a centralised soup pot, to take turns to scoop the soup using a common ladle instead of their own eating utensils. These new habits can help reduce the spread of any virus and maintain better hygiene.

 [COVID-19 Awareness Workshop closing soon]
 Terence is the last presenter today as he shares more about how to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and wiping down drills procedures.
 

 Water drinking activity to illustrate the meaning of Mindfulness by guest presenter, Erin Lee, to help the caregivers and subsequently their children to stay centred in the presence.
 

 The benefit of using mindfulness is to channel our focus on our body instead of the mind and as such, we will be more aware of what is happening inside us.
 

 Mindfulness is not about distracting ourselves away from anxiety or stress, it is about knowing when you are stress and when to bring yourself to a calm state, especially helpful as many may feel stressed about the COVID-19 situation now.

 [1 hour before COVID-19 Awareness Workshop]
 

 [8 hours to COVID-19 Workshop, 1 April 2020]
 00:30hr Singapore time, Zoom finally worked properly on the borrowed laptop just 8 hours before the commencement of our online workshop in Myanmar. 
 Tonight, Joseph and Kee will be staying overnight at the campsite in Hmawbi after setting up the meeting hall and preparing breakfast and lunch for the caregivers late into the night.
 Caregivers from 22 homes will be making their way to gather at the campsite at about 8.30am in the morning in a few hours' time. Some needing to travel 2 - 3 hours to get there.
 In times of crisis, there are opportunities. This is the first time Joseph and his team had to learn to set up all the required technology before a workshop without the physical presence of a volunteer from Singapore to assist.
 Technology that we usually take for granted in urban cities are not readily available in rural places. We had to ensure that the power generator had enough diesel to run electricity to prevent any chance of power failure. We were unable to download Zoom app on the borrowed laptop for some reason and had to learn to log on to Zoom using the Internet browser which took the machine quite a while to load. 
 Since Joseph will be the translator of the workshop, he underwent the training himself prior to the workshop, going through himself all the steps of wiping down, hand washing, etc so that he now has the practical experience to guide the caregivers to do the same, thus the caregivers can guide the children to do the same at home.
 We are glad that all finally went well as of now. 
 Then again, we are always mentally prepared for the worst. 
 But no matter what challenges life may throw at us, we shall not deviate from our objective - 
 To safeguard those whom we care for through the transference of knowledge and resources.
 

 Our workshop is now scheduled on 1 April 2020, 9.30am - 3.30pm Myanmar time.
 

 At this moment in time, we are running a rehearsal between the Singapore team and Myanmar Team to familiarise with the equipment, the flow of the 8 modules and to ensure that the internet is fast enough to host a smooth Zoom Conference session.
 

 The plan now is that tomorrow we will gather caregivers from 22 homes to a common campsite. Then we will connect our laptop to Zoom with the Singapore team and projected on a screen. This way, all caregivers can see our presentation slides and our faces. 
 

 We will share more updates soon!
 

 ] A part of the 8 modules of our training package is about the correct way of using Cocorex. This compilation is made by Terence Chiew and translated by Joseph.

 Ever since Myanmar has reported its first 2 confirmed cases, the authority has been taking new measures and the situations are changing by the hour. 
 

 As such, our COVID-19 project has to change to fit in.
 

 Here are some changes as of today:
 

 - Distribution of items (stage 1) will take place tomorrow, 27 March 2020 and 28 March 2020. This is because certain regions where there are confirmed cases have either been locked down or are locking down. There are now stricter 'border control' within different states and towns and we forsee that in the worst case, regions where our homes are located, may be isolated. As such, we will bring forward item distribution from 2 April 2020 to the coming 2 days. Furthermore, the children and widows need these items even more urgently now. 
 

 - The Myanmar team led by Joseph will start to teach the homes some basic know-how when distributing items to them. This includes safety precautions when using Chlorox and hand sanitizer, what to do with them, how children should clean and so on. We will strengthen these knowledge on 2 April 2020 during the actual workshop. 
 

 - We are providing the caregivers assess to 4G data card (or credits) now as in case there is a total lock down by end of this month, they are still accessible by video. Though live streaming might not be possible, at least we can still send videos to them on our knowledge of the virus and messages. They can send their videos back to us. This way we achieve knowledge transfer and monitoring via 'batch processing' instead of 'real time processing'.
 

 - Even gathering of 24+ caregivers at 1 common location is no longer a good idea with all these 'border control' in place. The plan now is to break the caregivers into 2 clusters at 2 different geographical locations and train them separately on 2 different days - 1 April 2020 and 2 April 2020.
 

 - A contingency plan is to train the Myanmar team very well on 1 April 2020 so that they can be the one training the rest even in our absence. We really hope this won't happen as there could be 'information dilution', eg. when information is passed from one person to another unsupervised. This is just to prepare for the worst case scenario.
 

 We will update again should there be more changes nearing the date of the workshops.
 

 [COVID-19 Workshop Item Distribution Part 3]
 

 After a 14-hour distribution, at about 10.30pm SG time, We have reached 21 out of 22 homes today.
 

 The last home, Canaan Children Home, will receive theirs tomorrow morning. Thereafter, stage 1 of the project will come to a close.
 

 We will share more updates on stage 2 and 3 soon! 
 

 [COVID-19 Workshop Item Distribution Part 2]
 

 As of this moment, we have reached 9 homes, namely 
 

 Bethlehem-B Children Home
 Emmanuel-B Children Home
 New Hope Children Home 
 Bawathit Children Home
 Love and Mercy Home
 Crown Orphanage
 Faith Children Home
 Home of Light 
 Abundant Life Children Home
 

 We aim to reach all 22 homes by the end of today or we will continue tomorrow.
 

 We do the best we can to better safe guard the children and widows against COVID-19.
 

 This morning, we started travelling and distributing the items to various children and widows homes to help equip them with 'ammunitions' to prevent, detect and fight against COVID-19 virus.
 

 As of this moment, we have reached 3 homes, namely 
 

 Faith Children Home
 Home of Light 
 Abundant Life Children Home
 

 We aim to reach all 22 homes by the end of today or we will continue tomorrow.
 

 We do the best we can to better safe guard the children and widows against COVID-19.
 

 One of the 8 modules of our training package is about the ways to prevent catching an infection. This compilation is made by Terence Chiew and translated by Joseph. More elaboration on this topic will be shared during the workshop on 1 and 2 April 2020. Feel free to share this info-video around to raise awareness and benefit more friends in Myanmar! 
 

 One of the 8 modules of our training package is about the recommended way of 'wiping down' the homes to minimise the spread of the virus. The video is recorded by one of our volunteers from Scotland, Eric and his colleague, Helen. Although the living conditions of the village families are different from the urban environment shown in this video, we will use this video to help the families and children understand the main points which includes - Chlorox needs to be diluted before use - Clean all areas which are commonly touched - Scrubbing toilet areas is essential Other relavant points that we will cover in our training that is not shown in this video include - Recommended ways of disposal of used cleaning agents - Safety precautions for storing and handling (especially with children at home) Feel free to share this videos around to raise awareness and benefit more friends in Myanmar.
 

 Our team in Singapore is currently preparing a training package consisting of 8 modules to train the caregivers from 24 homes for children and widows on 2 April 2020. One of the modules is about the proper way of washing hands to maximise the killing of any virus on them. Our content leader, Terence Chiew, together with his nephew, recorded this demonstration video and Joseph provided the translation. One of our goals on 2 April 2020 is to practise with the 24 caregivers so that they can subsequently train the rest of the 360 children and widows at homes on these steps. Feel free to share this videos around to raise awareness and benefit more friends in Myanmar. Proper hand washing is one of the best ways to fight against COVID-19.","Hmawbi, Myanmar

 For the past 2 days, we have been travelling from shops to shops around Yangon to look for thermometer, anti- bacteria soap, disinfectants, multi-vitamins and so on while comparing prices and checking the ingredient lists of various products.
 

 Communication between the Myanmar and Singapore Team and all decision making were done online so that we can buy as much as we can to cater to 400 children, widows and their caregivers while keeping as close to our budget as possible.
 

 As of today, we have completed about 70% of stage 1 with the combined effort of Joseph in Myanmar and Mabel Ho in Singapore.
 

 Preparation for stage 2 has also started in Singapore led by Terence Chiew and the volunteers have started researching and compiling a training package. 
 

 We will update more once we have reached another significant milestone.
 

 We would also like to thank our readers for sending us your well wishes and even useful contents about COVID-19!

11,2020,[Rice for Hope @ Yangon General Hospital],Necessities,Rice for Hope,"We are pleased to share that our 1st ever project with a local hospital in Myanmar has finally happened this late morning at Medical Unit 2 of YGH. 
 

 We have shared 170 packs of warm meals to the patients and their caregivers during lunch time in an effort to reduce the financial burdens of the warded patients and their family members as they seek medical treatment there.
 

 The type of food was chosen after consulting the doctors as different patients have different dietary requirements and the caterer is a trusted party of the hospital who has supplied food multiple times before.
 

 Our Rice-for-Hope Team aims to continue sharing cooked meals to patients in public hospitals in Myanmar on a monthly basis and hopefully with more support in future, we could share meals more frequently.
 

 Each pack of rice is currently priced at about S$1.70 but the price may fluctuate from time to time depending on ingredients, quality and quantity.

12,2020,"Changes to Upcoming COVID-19 Awareness & Action Workshop on 2 April 2020 i.e. REPLACE the upcoming GVH 5th Education & Discovery Camp with: ""COVID-19 Awareness & Action Workshop""",Education,Training and Development,"[Updated 27 March 2020] ***Changes to Upcoming COVID-19 Awareness & Action Workshop on 2 April 2020 *** Ever since Myanmar has reported its first 2 confirmed cases, the authority has been taking new measures and the situations are changing by the hour. As such, our COVID-19 project has to change to fit in. Here are some changes as of today: - Distribution of items (stage 1) will take place tomorrow, 27 March 2020 and 28 March 2020. This is because certain regions where there are confirmed cases have either been locked down or are locking down. There are now stricter 'border control' within different states and towns and we forsee that in the worst case, regions where our homes are located, may be isolated. As such, we will bring forward item distribution from 2 April 2020 to the coming 2 days. Furthermore, the children and widows need these items even more urgently now. - The Myanmar team led by Joseph will start to teach the homes some basic know-how when distributing items to them. This includes safety precautions when using Chlorox and hand sanitizer, what to do with them, how children should clean and so on. We will strengthen these knowledge on 2 April 2020 during the actual workshop. - We are providing the caregivers assess to 4G data card (or credits) now as in case there is a total lock down by end of this month, they are still accessible by video. Though live streaming might not be possible, at least we can still send videos to them on our knowledge of the virus and messages. They can send their videos back to us. This way we achieve knowledge transfer and monitoring via 'batch processing' instead of 'real time processing'. - Even gathering of 24+ caregivers at 1 common location is no longer a good idea with all these 'border control' in place. The plan now is to break the caregivers into 2 clusters at 2 different geographical locations and train them separately on 2 different days - 1 April 2020 and 2 April 2020. - A contingency plan is to train the Myanmar team very well on 1 April 2020 so that they can be the one training the rest even in our absence. We really hope this won't happen as there could be 'information dilution', eg. when information is passed from one person to another unsupervised. This is just to prepare for the worst case scenario. We will update again should there be more changes nearing the date of the workshops. Reported by The GVH COVID-19 Workshop Committee ------ The earlier post on 18 March 2020 ----- Knowing the cramp living conditions of the children we are supporting and their usual way of life, we foresee that should COVID-19 were to spread, it could affect everyone in a short amount of time. Additionally, all these homes are living on basic food, shelter and clothing. They are mainly ill-equipped to detect and guard against viruses like COVID-19. (None of the home has a functioning thermometer!!) Internet access is not easily affordable to the locals living in villages. Though the caregivers have access to 4G network, video streaming is not common and children do not have access to the internet. As such, information about COVID-19 (how to detect, how to prevent, how to react, what has been happening around the world) may not be readily accessible by them. Even if they have come across some information on social media like Facebook, the amount of misinformation and fake news floating around these days is not helpful at all and may unknowing cause physical and emotional harm to them. With all these in mind, the GVH Camp Committee decided to educate and train the caregivers and children about COVID-19 during the period 1 - 4 April 2020. ""COVID-19 Awareness & Action Workshop"" aims to accomlish it's purpose in 3 stages namely Stage 1: Equipment Stage 2: Awareness Stage 3: Monitoring *Stage 1* Stage 1 has already started as the team raise funds and purchase 'Anti COVID-19 Ammunitions'. These include - 1 digital thermometer for every child - Disinfectants (with recommended bactericidal agent) and cleaning tools for every home - Lots of hand washing and bathing soaps for every child - Hand sanitizer for every child - Medications for fever, cough, sore throat - 3-ply face mask in case a child fall sick - Multi vitamin or Vitamin C Pills to strengthen the body - And other miscellaneous useful items We target to equip all children homes in our GVH community within the next 1 week. *Stage 2* The volunteers in Singapore, led by Mabel, a trained and experienced pharmacist, will work together to compile an anti-COVID-19 training package. Information that will be compiled includes 1. Understanding what Covid-19 is 2. Prevent of catching an infection 3. Proper steps of washing hands 4. Wipe-down drill for homes 5. Monitoring for covid-19 symptoms 6. How to react if someone is sick? 7. Where to find accurate information on Covid-19 happenings in Myanmar? To help minimise movement, the Singapore team will meet electronically to compile the training package (likely on 31 March 2020 or earlier) The content and methods will be shared first with our Myanmar Leader, Joseph, so that he fully understood the content and is able to perform accurate translations during the main workshop. This is likely to take place on 1 April 2020. We will then gather all caregivers from 23 children homes at a well ventilated place with reliable electricity for our projector and 4G signal (likely on 2 April 2020) for the LIVE streaming of our training to take place. (GVH will bare all cost of electricity and 4G cost) This LIVE workshop will consist of both theory and practical and will last for the entire day. (3 meals provided by GVH) The primary goal of this workshop is to train the caregivers well enough so that they can deliver the same training to their children back home in their villages. Whatever new habits we would like the children to develop (such as temperature taking, social distancing, properly hand washing), we will develop in the caregivers during the 1-day workshop. *Stage 3* When the caregivers return home, they will conduct their training the next day to the children and lead them into developing new Anti-COVID-19 habits. We will require the caregivers to record videos and take photos of their progress at home and then send them to the Singapore team for review, monitoring and improvement suggestions. (4G connections for this purpose for all homes will be paid by GVH) This process will likely take place on 3 and 4 April 2020. As such, we foresee that the entire workshop will need about 5 days to complete. (1-day preparation in Singapore and 4-day execution in Myanmar and Singapore) The Singapore volunteers are confident that with our collective expertise, we will be able to provide an effective training program to better safe guard the 400 children and widows who are currently in our umbrella of care. We thank you for reading our plans till this point and if you have any suggestions how we could improve the process or even contribute (time, talent, treasure) to this last minute initiative, please drop us a message or contact Linus, Mabel or Terence directly. Thank you for your continual support! And stay safe and united! The GVH Team

13,2020,GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 64th month since Nov 2014,Necessities,Rice for Hope,"In Mar 2020, 53 sacks of rice were distributed to 23 homes for children and widows. This includes 2 new homes known as Victory Children Home and New Life Children Home. Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Mar 2020. Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks Mother Bosom: 2 sacks Bethel Home: 3 sacks Widow Home: 2 sacks Love & Mercy: 3 sacks Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks Faith Home: 2 sacks Noble Home: 2 sacks Canaan Home: 3 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 2 sacks Home of Light: 2 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 3 sacks New Hope Home: 4 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 1 sack Grace Care Children Home: 1 sacks Bethlehem-II Children Home: 2 sacks Victory Children Home: 2 sacks New Life Children Home: 2 sacks Background Information: These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas. Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables. We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet. While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved. Since Nov 2014, a total of 2127 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors. The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint: Crown Orphanage: 199 sacks Ebenezer Home: 204 sacks Mother Bosom: 187 sacks Grace Home: 79 sacks Canaan Home: 145 sacks Faith Home: 130 sacks Lawknu Home: 89 sacks Boarding School: 2 sacks Widow Homes: 91 sacks Bethel Home: 159 sacks Hope Home: 3 sacks Love & Mercy: 99 sacks Lighthouse Home: 139 sacks Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks Noble Home: 68 sacks Htun (Eagle) Home: 71 sacks Abundant Life Home: 62 sacks Emmenuel Home: 62 sacks GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 43 sacks (+ 80 pkts of milk powder + 27 tins of baby food) Home of Light: 26 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 22 sacks New Hope Home: 27 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 10 sacks Grace Care Children Home: 9 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 12 sacks Victory Children Home: 2 sacks New Life Children Home: 2 sacks Grace Refuge: 1 sack Mercy Home: 4 sacks Home in Kachin: 2 sacks Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack Blessed Children Home (Shan): 10 sacks Grace Family Children Home (Shan): 3 sacks Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015) Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes) Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019) As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share. Thank you for supporting our 'Rice for Hope' initiative! The GVH Team.

 Distribution of sacks of rice to 23 children homes and widow homes have completed for the month of March 2020.
 

 54 sacks of rice, each 50kg, were shared with about 380 children and 15 widows in our umbrella of care. 
 

 These days, distribution is mostly done by a truck to various locations at the outskirts of Yangon where the small children homes and widow homes are found. 
 

 Every month, we usually only share photos of children together with the rice they received.
 

 This month, we take a look at some snapshots of what has been happening behind the scene :)

14,2020,[GVH 26th Water Well Project],Necessities,Water Supply,"We are pleased to share that this water project at Wat Inn Pok village is a success!
 

 This water well will serve 30 people from 13 families in this village for years to come. 
 

 Recently, our exploration efforts brought us to this village where we met the people who are all from Rakhine State. This village has only been established for 5 months and they were actually part of the thousands of people who were displaced due to a civil war that is happening now in that region.
 

 While searching for new home, they came by this area, recommended by a pastor, where the indigenous people offered their land to these war-displaced people at an affordable price. As of today, most of them are still jobless and they were mainly farmers back in Rakhine state. 
 

 They are currently surviving mainly from random donations while they set up their new-found home.
 

 During our 1st contact with them, we realised that the villagers dug for themselves 2 wells (See photo) to hold rain water and underground water where water is extracted using a pail with rope but the wells often run out of water. 
 

 As such, we decided to dig one for them that is deeper and can extract more water. 
 

 As of 12 March 2020, we have reached water!
 

 This project is in partnership with the employees of Surbana-Jurong who has contributed to our water project in October 2019.
 

 If anyone is keen to support more water wells for the poorer region of Myanmar, do drop us a message or refer to www.gvh.sg/contribute-funds/ for more information.",Wat Inn Pok village,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1277792262413868,,,,,17.1958054,96.2142522
15,2020,5th Edu Camp,Education,Training and Development,"[66.54% funded, 21 days to 5th Edu Camp]
 

 Yesterday, 10 March 2020, the GVH 5th Education Camp Committee gathered for the 1st time in Singapore to plan for the upcoming education camp in Myanmar (1 - 4 April 2020).
 

 Among several points, the current COVID-19 issue was raised and discussed among all volunteers present. This discussion was led by a neutral party and friend, Phoon Kok Hwa, a long time donor and volunteer of GVH and not a member of the foundation's management committee nor a member of the camp organizing committee. 
 

 After a 1.5-hour open-hearted and open-minded discussion, 7 out of 14 volunteers present at the meeting decided to continue to serve in the upcoming camp by being physically present at the camp venue in Myanmar, 6 out of 14 decided to support in Singapore in terms of preparation and remote support during the camp duration and 1 of 14 is still pending a decision.
 

 Apart from these 14 volunteers, 2 other volunteers who were absent from the meeting have earlier committed to proceed with the camp and 5 other volunteers who were absent from this meeting due to work commitments are still pending a decision as of this message.
 

 All in all, out of our team of 21 volunteers:
 

 Supporting in Myanmar: 9
 Supporting in Singapore: 6
 Withdraw to support the Camp: 0
 Pending a decision: 6
 

 With regards to the format of the camp, the team acknowledged that there are risks involved to both volunteers and children during the camp despite the fact that no case has been confirmed in Myanmar so far. 
 

 As of today, we decided to still go ahead with the camp but to make changes to the way the camp will be run.
 

 Some of the key changes include
 

 - Instead of a 4-day camp for all 350 children and youth, we will break the camp into 3 clusters, each consisting of 100+ children and they will only go through a 1-day 1-night program. Doing it this way will further reduce the chance of any unlikely infection and yet achieve the educational objective of the camp.
 

 - Cluster 1 will be from 1 April (10am) - 2 April (10am)
 

 - Cluster 2 will be from 2 April (12pm) - 3 April (12pm) 
 

 - Cluster 3 will be from 3 April (2pm) - 4 April (2pm) 
 

 - Any children and volunteer who developed cough, flu-like symptoms or fever within 14 days before the camp will be strictly prohibited to appear at the campsite. SG volunteers who have known contact with anyone in LOA are also discouraged from going. 
 

 - All children and adults present at the campsite will be have their temperature measured at least twice a day.
 

 - Strictly no sharing of food and utensils during the camp. 
 

 - Volunteers from Singapore will no longer be leading any teams in team games and any activities which involves any form of body contact. Team leading will be done by local youths instead.
 

 - During daily clusters switching, children from one cluster will not be allowed to get closed to children from the next cluster. Ideally, most of the children should have left the campsite by the time the next cluster arrives. In between clusters, we will have 2 hours to disinfect and clean sleeping areas and the activity hall.
 

 - Group photo taking in camp will not be carried out.
 

 - A segregated 'sick bay' will be prepared for anyone who feel unwell during the 1- day camp per cluster. 
 

 - Most importantly, through this 1-day camp, the children will be educated more about COVID-19, it's threat, how to best minimise the chance of getting infected and how to react appropriately in the event if someone is feeling unwell. Through the camp, the Singapore team hope to demonstrate to the children ways to be more hygienic and lead them into practising these ways so that they can continue on when they return back to their own homes during the school break. 
 

 - We will continue to monitor the situation in Myanmar and the camp might still be cancelled in the event that the Myanmar government has issued certain restrictions and new safety rules which mandatory criteria our camp does not meet. We will make an announcement shall this happen.
 

 At this point, the camp organizing committee is extremely grateful to you for your continual trust in our work and for your support for this camp. 
 

 As of this writing, the camp is 66.54% funded. If you are keen to lend a small support, please refer to this link for more details and PM us via Facebook or contact Linus, Mabel or Kah Seng.

 [43.31% funded, 25 days to 5th Edu Camp!]
 

 Preparation started in Myanmar today as caregivers of various children homes and orphanages gathered to discuss the finer details of the camp including attendance, roles and precautions.
 

 The Singapore voluntary team will gather on 10 March to discuss the program flow, games, activities and the measures we will take to safe guard the children during the camp.
 

 Due to the recent global COVID-19 epidemic, we have also made several changes to the way the camp will be run to minimise the risk. We will share more details about this in due time.
 

 At the same time, this camp is an opportunity for us to transfer essential knowledge and experiences to the children and their caregivers to prepare them to respond effectively should an outbreak were to happen in Myanmar in future. 
 

 We will educate the village children more about the virus, hygiene and other useful knowledge related to biology and their body while having fun together!
 

 With your support, the camp is now 43.31% funded. Should you be keen to support the camp, please have a look at this camp info page!

 1 month to our 5th GVH Education Camp in Hmawbi, Myanmar! This year's theme will revolve around science, recycling, hygiene and sexual education. 
 

 One of the new items we are adding into this year's goodie bag is hand sanitizer and we have prepared 430 bottles to be given to all children and their caregivers.
 

 The running of this camp is not without concerns of the recent outbreak of COVID-19 virus globally with Myanmar still has yet record it's 1st case till date. 
 

 We are constantly assessing the situation in Myanmar and we will be making changes to the format of the camp to minimise the chance of spread of the virus while maintaining the learning outcome and fun factor of the camp for the children who are so looking forward to this annual event. 
 

 Our camp volunteer meeting in Singapore is scheduled to take place on 10 March 2020 and we will share more updates once we have made more decisions nearer to the camp date (1 April- 4 April)
 

 At the meantime, our fund raising efforts will carry on and we are currently at 34.23% of our target. Please have a look at

16,2020,[Solar System Project],Necessities,Electric Power,"Crown orphanage was the first children home we partnered with since 2014. Recently, they had to move to a new location as the lease to their previous home has expired. 
 

 This new location is a permanent one and they were able to pool resources together to construct their own home structure, toilets and a water well. Their plan now is to build their new home using zinc and bamboo first to meet the immediate need of having a shelter for the children with the intention of building a permanent structure on cement and bricks in the future. 
 

 As this location does not have any electric supply unlike their previous location, our GVH Solar Team decided to provide a loan of a solar power system to power up the home for now.
 

 Electricity will allow the lighting up of the home at night so that the children can continue to study after night fall. Ceiling fan will help to ventilate the rooms which is essential especially during the hot and dry season. Several years back, a friend of GVH donated a small used TV to them which they are still using today to occasionally entertain and educate the children.
 

 The loan of this solar system will expire once this village has their own electrical supply from the government in future. After which, the system can be reused to help another children home that is in need of electricity.
 

 The children of this home are also the beneficiaries of our monthly Rice for Hope Project, Bursary project, Festive projects and they have been attending our education camp every year in April without fail. 
 

 We are glad to be of some help to support their good work of upbringing disadvantaged children in rural Myanmar.

18,2020,[School Improvement Project],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We are pleased to share that this school in Iwady region (about 6 hours west of Yangon) has gotten their school fence installed! 
 

 Our last trip to this school was in December 2019 during our annual Santa Mission. A snap shot of that trip can be found here:
 

 https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1213975908795504&id=375770749282695
 

 We first met this school about 4 years ago which was started by a lady who wanted to bring education closer to the kids in this farming region after realising that children in this region do not attend school as schools are very far away. 
 

 She then converted her own home into a school initially and after running this school privately for several years, she eventually gotten her school recognised by the government as an official public school.
 

 Over the past 4 years, we have assisted this school by improving its structures (patching broken floors and walls), installing solar power system, building a new toilet, installing water pump and adding essential teaching tools and furniture into the classrooms. 
 

 Through the support of one of our donors (who prefer to stay anonymous), we further improved the school by funding the construction of the school fence during our Santa Mission trip in December 2019.
 

 The school has just gotten back to us that the fence is now completed!
 

 Our team is glad to have this chance to work with the villagers and the school for the past 4 years and to see how this school gradually improve over the years. 
 

 The school even has their own speaker system now which they can use to teach music and dance to the children more effectively!
 

 We are currently looking at improving the footpath and mini bridges so that the path to school can be safer for the children. 
 

 We will share more updates on that when we have more concrete plans. 
 

 We thank you always for following our work to improve the lives of villages and children in the rural communities.",school in Iwady region (about 6 hours west of Yangon),https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1270631113129983,,,,,,
19,2020,[School Improvement Project],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We have recently completed a mini project to help this school located at Mya Chun Thar Chuck Tel Su village located about 4 hours south east of Yangon nearby the seashore. 
 

 This school is started locally by the village and yet to be recognised as an official government school although the chief of the village has been submitting documents to the authority for approval.
 

 At the present moment, this school has only 1 teacher and her salary is partially paid by the village chief himself and an organization known as NFPE (Non Formal Primary Education) which supports village schools to teach children aged 9 to 11. 
 

 The school was established by the village chief in July 2018 after he realised that 23 of the 56 children in the village was unable to attend school. This is because they are young and the nearest government school from their village is 45 min walk away. Such walk to school becomes even harder and more dangerous during the 4-month rainy season especially for children aged 11 and below. As such, the village chief decided to use his own financial resources to create a small school for them then. Today, the school now has 53 students and there are 60 families in this small village.
 

 After assessing their current situation, our team felt that it is a worthy cause to support the good work of this school and to help enhance the learning environment there by a little.
 

 Together with our sponsors, we provide the school with 
 

 - 5 new benches (after buying raw material for the carpenter to make them) so now all children have space to write on
 

 - 2 whiteboards and various markers, dusters and refill for the teacher to use as teaching tool.
 

 The school has also requested for help to build a new toilet and to extend the current school to create more space for the children.
 

 We are currently looking into these requests and will share more details once we have them.",Mya Chun Thar Chuck Tel Su village located about 4 hours south east of Yangon,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1260205054172589,,,,,,
20,2020,[GVH Rice-for-Hope Project],Necessities,Rice for Hope,"This morning, Linus and Joseph met up with Dr Tin Aung Kyaw and Dr Tin Tin Ohm of Yangon General Hospital to discuss how GVH foundation could support the patients warded in this hospital. Our 'Rice for Hope' initiative have been supporting disadvantaged children from various children home for 6 years now. In 2020, the project team aims to extend this project by providing warm meals to patients warded in public hospitals as well. This is because at the present moment, public hospitals in Yangon do not have their own food provision facilities. As such, warded patients and their caregivers have to support their own daily food needs. We learnt that various local charitable groups have been lending their helping hands to public hospital patients by gathering funds to prepare warm meals for these patients. The goal of such initiatives is to help lighten the financial burden of patients who, more often than not, are among the lower income group of society thus they seek free medical aids and enduring long queues at public hospitals instead of seeking medical help from the private ones. Many warded patients in Yangon General Hospital are also not from Yangon. They are from the more rural areas and travelled long distances to seek desperate medical attention in Yangon. Although medical help in public hospitals is free, patients and their caregivers suffer lost of daily wages (as they are usually paid by work-days) and have to pay for more expensive meals in the city in order to continue their medical treatment here. According to Dr Tin, the hospital usually has about 1800 - 2000 warded patients on a typical day and many of them have special dietary requirements based on the ailments they are suffering from. Current warm food support from various local charitable groups are usually on ad hoc basis and are only supporting a fraction of the food needs of their patients. Cost of warm meals cost between 1400ks and 2000ks ($1.40 - $2.00) per meal which mainly consist of rice, chicken and soup. Our 'Rice for Hope' team aims to support patients of Yangon General Hospital by providing warm meals for patients as far as we could. We will start small for now and hopefully as time goes by, with more contributors, we could organically support the patients more. As Mother Teresa once said 'If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one.' The journey of a thousand mile starts from the 1st step. Our 1st step of 'Rice for Hope' for disadvantaged children started in November 2014 and we have seen its organic growth over the past 6 years. Now, we decided to take our 1st step for hospital patients from March 2020. Do drop us a note if you are keen to join force with us to impact the lives of warded patients by a little.",Yangon General Hospital,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1258892774303817,,,,,,
21,2020,[Improving Children's Well-being Project],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"Recently, caregivers from Grace Care Children Home, who takes care of 6 disadvantaged children, feedback that they hope to lay carpets or mats on the floor so as to improve the sleeping condition of the children who have been sleeping on the floor. In addition, to also improve the learning environment of these children at home by installing a whiteboard so that the caregivers could use to as a teaching tool. 
 

 At the same time, the caregivers of Love & Mercy Children Home also feedback that ever since they increased the number of children to 17, they have to cook rice 3 times for every meal in order to cook enough for their consumption. This is because the rice cooker they are using is a small one. Thus they requested for a larger rice cooker. 
 

 After assessing their current situations, we felt that these are worthy causes and could improve the well-being of these disadvantaged children by a little. The cost of these items are also not easily affordable by these homes as it can cost about half of their average monthly income. Comparing with other more basic needs like food, clothing and shelter, these items are usually at the bottom of their priority list to purchase with their limited financial resources.
 

 We would like to thank Ida Widjaja who decided to partner with us to provide the large size rice cooker, the whiteboard and the carpets as part of her birthday-giving this year.
 

 We are currently still assessing more call-for-assistance from other homes who requested for items like building materials, toilets, water wells, solar system and so on to improve the living conditions of their children. 
 

 We will share more update once we completed our assessment and if anyone is keen to also improve the well-being of these children, feel free to drop us a message with your intention to help. We will be in touch once we have decided to support the next home.","Grace Care Children Home

 In Feb 2020, 65 sacks of rice were distributed to 23 homes for children and widows. This includes 2 homes we met in Shan State. 
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Feb 2020.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 3 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 3 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 3 sacks
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks
 Widow Home: 2 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 3 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks
 Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 2074 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 195 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 200 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 185 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 142 sacks

 Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019)
 

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.

24,2020,[Shan State Exploration],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"About 4 hours journey south of Blessed Children Home in Keng Tung region, we arrived at Tachileik, a town just nearby the Thai-Myanmar border. Here, we met the children of Grace Family Children Home who are all from Shan state. 
 

 The home was started in 2011 when the founder saw many children in the villages loitering around and not able to attend school thus he decided to do something about it. 
 

 He started by contributing a piece of land that he owns and together with a local church and some friends, funded and constructed this premise over time to house children who are either orphaned, or wasn't able to go to school in their villages and provided them with shelter and food so that they can attend school in town. 
 

 Of the 25 children who currently reside in this home today, only 4 of them have parents who could fully afford the daily needs of their own children, 6 children have family members who could only afford to partially cover the daily needs of their own children while the remaining 15 children are fully supported by the founder of the home as they are mainly abandoned by their original family. 
 

 The main reason why the family of those 10 children chose to send their children to stay in this home is due to the lack of educational opportunities in their villages. 
 

 The founder shared that although these children are from different family and financial background, the children are all treated equally in this home and he has no intention to establish this home as a profit making entity. It's main mission is to help children who have no family and create the opportunity for children from remote villages to gain access to public education in Shan state. 
 

 In term of sustainability, the founder did mentioned that most of the expenses of the home is covered by donors from a local church for the past 7 years. However, due to certain circumstances, this source of funding will cease by end of March (end of 2019/2020 academic year) and the home will need to sustain by itself.
 

 The founder is building a hostel for people to rent so that rental income from this hostel can be used to pay for the daily needs like food, educational material and clothing of the children. There is no guarantee that this idea will work as planned but he is willing to give this venture a shot.
 

 We admire the heart of the founder and his family for these children and we wish them the very best in building their children home to be self sustainable. 
 

 As a small support to these children, we represented our contributors in Singapore and supplied the following to them:
 

 - 3 sacks of rice 
 - 3 kg of pork 
 - other food items like fish, vege, onion, drinks
 - drinking cup 
 

 We would like to also thank this home for offering their premise for us to bunk in during our brief stay in Tachileik. 
 

 We thank you, reader of our stories and contributor to our Rice for Hope initiative and education projects to enable us to continue our work of reaching out to children in rural part of Myanmar.

 www.gvh.sg/contribute-funds
 

 We arrived at Mong Khet region where we met 16 more children taken care by Joseph Juya. This premise is actually the home of Joseph's elder brother who have a few children of his own and 2 of them have already grown up and are currently working in China. 
 

 Joseph Juya's hope for these children is that they could progress well in their studies and to do well enough to become useful members of society so that they could earn a comfortable living in future for themselves and their community.
 

 As this is only his 4th year taking care of children, in this coming March, some of his children will be sitting for Grade 11 high school exam for a shot for university entrance. 
 

 We sincerely wish these children the very best for their upcoming exams and may they do the best they could.
 

 On behalf of our contributors, we have provided the following supplies to this home (we shall address it as Blessed Children Home B):
 

 - 216 dozens of exercise books
 - 48 pencils 
 - 60 pens 
 - 7 sacks of rice 
 - ingredients like potato, onion, eggs
 - cooking oil
 - bathing soap and detergent
 

 Joseph Juya expressed his sincere gratitude to donors of the GVH community for sending these gifts for the children and he mentioned that this is the 1st time they have received such quantity of donations. 
 

 We are also considering if there is a possibility for our GVH Education and Bursary project to also impact children in this region.
 

 If any reader is keen to support the education of children in rural region like this, do drop us a message via this FB page or find out more by reading my website here:

 By bike, we travelled from Blessed Children Home at Keng Teng towards Mong Khet region for more than 3 hours to another children home started by Joseph. This home currently takes care of 16 orphans and poor children.
 

 Along the way, we passed by 5 villages in this mountainous region where we spent sometime interacting with the local people.
 

 According to the local, no NGO has ever provided assistance to these villages before. Their water supply here is also limited and of low quality. Water wells typically dry up in summertime as well.
 

 There is also no government school located in these villages so children here are mostly (if not all) uneducated just like their parents and grandparents. Villagers here depend mainly on cultivation of rice for a living.
 

 The villagers here mostly 'spirit worshippers' as such, in times of needs or crisis, they mainly pray to appease the spirits for their mercy (They believe they must have angered the spirits)
 

 Typically when people fall sick in these villages, they do not seek medical help at all. They believe that doctors will harm them because they could not afford the bills and that if one passed on in the hospital, the body will not be returned to the village. As such, these villagers would rather depend on themselves at home when they are ill and choose to perish in their own village.
 

 Our contact person here, Joseph Juya, 36, who has Grade 8 education, have been working tireless in these villages to let the indigenous people understand more about the world beyond their village and why educating children is of utmost importance. 
 

 To Joseph Juya, it is important for children in this region to learn to speak Mandarin and get a qualification so that there is a higher chance of employment in China or in local based Chinese companies for the betterment of these children's lives in the future.
 

 He continues to dedicate much time on bringing schools into the villages and encouraging parents to send their children to school.
 

 Areas which GVH can consider doing for these villages includes
 

 - Building Water Wells which can provide year-long water supply 
 

 - Conduct hygiene and health related education to broaden the knowledge horizons of these villagers 
 

 We will share more updates as we journey along.
 

 The gentleman who started Blessed Children Home in Keng Teng, Shan State, in 2009 is called Joseph. He currently takes care of 9 children who are either orphans or from broken family in this particular premise.
 

 About 1.5 years ago, caregiver Joseph got to know the work that GVH is doing and contacted us for assistance. As their home is located very far away from where we usually operate, we could only make the long hour trip to meet his home today. 
 

 This home is currently supported from its own farming output and random support from Joseph's friends from church. The farm generates about S$90 per month on average which is barely enough to pay for food and daily expenses of the home.
 

 During our visit today, we bought the following items to support the good work of Joseph:
 

 - 3 sacks of rice 
 - Exercise books and stationery for 9 children
 - 360 eggs
 - 8 viss of cooking oil 
 - other cooking ingredients like curry powder etc 
 - Body soap
 

 Other things GVH will continue to support them includes school uniform and educational material for next academic year.
 

 There are other basic needs which we thought will be beneficial for the kids which we were unable to purchase this time due to our current available budget which includes 
 

 - mattresses (see photo of their current sleeping situation)
 - cold weather jacket (mainly due to winter season from Nov - Feb every year) - its quite costly to purchase new ones so we call for any reader to consider donating used and in good condition winter clothing (kids to teen size) in Singapore so we can bring over for them.
 

 We will share more information once we learn more about the children. 
 

 After a 30-hour and 1100km bus journey, we have arrived at the 1st destination - Keng Teng Township, Shan State.
 

 This adventure (lasting for about 11 days), will expose us to about 4 new children homes, 1 school and depending on available time, 1 or 2 villages where we will provide assistance to the children and community we come across. 
 

 We will share more updates of our impacts (and hopefully interesting stories and encounters) as we journey along. 
 

 At the meantime, it's about 11 degree in Keng Teng now and there is no available guest house. So it shall be a snooze at the bus station tonight before we journey again tomorrow morning by bike to the 1st children home where we will meet its caregiver, whose name is so coincidentally, also Joseph.

 In Jan 2020, 52 sacks of rice were distributed to 20 homes for children and widows.
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Jan 2020.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 3 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 0 sack
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks
 Widow Home: 2 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 3 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks
 Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks
 Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks
 Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks
 Faith Home: 2 sacks
 Noble Home: 2 sacks
 Canaan Home: 4 sacks
 Bawahthit Children Home: 3 sacks
 Home of Light: 2 sacks
 Emmanuel-II Home: 3 sacks
 New Hope Home: 4 sacks
 Bethel-II Children Home: 1 sack
 Grace Care Children Home: 1 sack
 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 2 sacks
 

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 2009 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 192 sacks
 Ebenezer Home: 197 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 182 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 139 sacks
 Faith Home: 125 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 89 sacks
 Boarding School: 2 sacks
 Widow Homes: 87 sacks
 Bethel Home: 153 sacks
 Hope Home: 3 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 93 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 133 sacks
 Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks
 Noble Home: 64 sacks
 Htun (Eagle) Home: 66 sacks
 Abundant Life Home: 58 sacks
 Emmenuel Home: 57 sacks
 GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks
 Bawahthit Children Home: 38 sacks (+ 80 pkts of milk powder + 27 tins of baby food)
 Home of Light: 21 sacks
 Emmanuel-II Home: 16 sacks
 New Hope Home: 20 sacks
 Bethel-II Children Home: 8 sacks
 Grace Care Children Home: 7
 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 8 sacks
 Grace Refuge: 1 sack
 Mercy Home: 4 sacks
 Home in Kachin: 2 sacks
 Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack
 Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks
 Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015)
 Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes)
 Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019)
 

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.
 

 Thank you for supporting our 'Rice for Hope' initiative!

 We are extremely grateful to be able to represent all of you to share joy with all the children over the past 7 days. 
 

 As a whole, this year's Santa Mission has reached out to about 400 children from 20 children homes around the outskirts of Yangon and a village school. 
 

 The next time we will connect with all these children again will be during our 5th GVH education camp which will be held 1 - 4 April 2020. 
 

 Do stay tuned for our call-for-volunteer and funds posts soon! Do send us a message to indicate your interest to join us in April 2020 and we will be in touch!
 

 The Santa Mission Team shall be back again on 20 Dec 2020.

 We will be teaching them some games which they have never played before and share with them gifts we brought from Singapore and Yangon :)

29,2019,School Improvement @ Iwady School,Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We are now at the school after a 6 hour trip on road and 30min on a boat. 
 

 Water Project here is rather tricky because drilling water well here is not feasible. This is because the school is located very near to deltas thus water quality underground is not suitable for drinking. 
 

 The villagers have therefore been depending on rain water which they collect using the roof of houses and large water lakes which were dug by their forefathers.
 

 So to help improve their water situation slightly, we installed a small water pump engine that is water proof which is immersed under water in a distant lake. Then using solar powered battery, to operate it and pump water through a long rubber hose to the school. This way, we add some convenient in access of water. 
 

 Today the villagers will pull a long wire from the lake to the school so that the engine can be controlled in the school premise. 
 

 This morning, the team is walking the ground to assess the road conditions and also their farming practices and hopefully chances to interact with the local farmer to understand their current way of life.",Iwady School,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1213683942158034,,,,,,

31,2019,[Christmas Day Solar Project],Necessities,Electric Power,"Our solar team arrived at Ngue Leah Kan Village School located in Hlegu area. 
 

 After meeting up with the village heads and school teachers on 23 Dec 2019 during our Santa Mission, we decided to support this school by lighting up all the classrooms using a standard solar power system on Christmas Day!
 

 The system consist of a 200W solar penal, a 100GS wet cell battery, a 500W Inverter, a 30A controller and 8 LED light bulbs with a combined 270W power output. 
 

 The system is on loan to this school for a period of 1 year before we reassess the school's situation again and how the solar system has helped improved the learning environment and opportunity for the elementary school students. 
 

 This project is spear headed by our Solar Project Leader, Bryan who has bigger plans to help bring electricity to more rural communities in rural area of Myanmar.
 

 This village is unique in a way that the land owner started offering very low cost land to Myanmar citizens who are homeless or from very poor background 3 years ago. Till today, there are 180 households with about 400 residents among which 46 are children attending school from kindergarten to Grade 5 level. 
 

 The school was constructed just this year by the collective efforts of the villagers who pooled their own money together to buy materials and to build the school themselves. The school is mainly built using bricks and bamboo with obvious holes on the ceiling and sandy floor. 
 

 The school is recognised by a nearby monastery such that students from this school can progress to that monastery school after passing their Grade 5 national exam. However, this school has yet been recognised by the government thus they do not receive any fundings from them. Thus teachers' fees are supported minimally by the villagers and 1 of the teachers is teaching voluntarily.
 

 The teachers' are willing to teach here because if the school does not exist here, these children would not be able to attend school. The teachers are therefore driven by passion and they can continue to teach as long as their own basic needs like food and shelter is manageable.
 

 The school teachers requested assistance is areas such as 
 

 - drinking water 
 - teaching tools
 - concrete flooring 
 - proper toilet 
 - school fence 
 - study material for students
 - library for adults and children
 

 We will continue to work with this village in the coming months to gradually improve the school and it's Learning and teaching capability and environment.",Ngue Leah Kan Village School located in Hlegu area,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1212497882276640,,,,,,

 We also brought with us Christmas goodies for the kids present at the celebrations who are mainly the grandchildren of most of these widows and we thank them for serving us Mohinga for lunch too!
 

 We are thankful to the 2 founders, Daw Lay Lay Phaw and Pastor Saw Tun Win for their great work of taking care of these widows with their basic needs like food, shelter and clothing although they themselves could barely make ends meet.
 

 GVH has been supporting their mission for 4 years now by providing sacks of rice and cooking oil on a monthly basis.

33,2019,Santa Mission 2019,Events,Santa Mission,"This is the team of volunteers for Santa Mission 2019. In fact, all 14 of us are only able to cross path for this short 15-minute period for the entire project duration. It's a precious moment in space and time for this photo opportunity because after that, this project team may never be able to all gather once again. But there is something truly special about this team - we are able to accomplish so much for the kids although we never really had a full volunteer meeting in Singapore prior to the event. We don't have any form of training or rehearsal before hand. We also do not have much time to prepare - some are having exams, some busy with work, some on family vacation etc. Yet, the programs turns out really enjoyable for the kids with very minimal crop ups. I think the key X-factor of this team, is that our ego level is really low and everyone places service of others above self as their number 1 priority. The team become efficient to respond to ad hoc challenges and everyone in the team is willing to cover for everyone else without complaint. We may only know one another for days but it felt like we have been working together for years. Everyone is also immensely patient - nobody complain about the super long hours on the road. We are willing to endure in silence any discomfort or sickness on the road. The team fits so well together that it renders a leader redundant. We just need to play our part and constantly predict what could go wrong and remind one another whether we have done our part. Everyone is so friendly, jovial and lovely. It's almost like a family. In addition, the 'invisible' angels in the GVH community added valuable 'fire power' at the back stage during the initial preparation phase - contributing their time, energy and funds. The Myanmar Team of caregivers from the 20 children homes played their part in organising the children and providing additional manpower at a snap of a finger. Apart from the 14 of us in the photo, there are easily another invisible 30 in Singapore and Myanmar who proactively and willingly contributed to the project without any interest to be recognised or credited. I am really at a lost of words to explain how all these can happen this way. Why are you so willing to help out? Why are you willing to go through discomfort, inconvenience and even hardship to do this? I guess I will never know the full answer. What I know is, our collective efforts have created something really beautiful for these kids. And it's not just for these 4 days. It has been 6 years now.

38,2019,[Santa Mission 2019 Day 0] / Santa Mission 2019,Events,Santa Mission,"A very long but really eventful 9 hours from 2.30pm - 11.30pm.
 

 We managed to complete our shopping of gifts in Sule, sorting and packing of gifts into 380 portions and even visited Shwedagon and Vista Bar!
 

 We are now all set for our early morning departure tomorrow at 7.30am to meet the 1st group of 120 children from 5 children homes in Hmawbi Township!
 

 It's now 12.30am in Yangon and nobody is willing to sleep yet =P
 

 The main team has assembled in Yangon! 
 

 Our main objective for today is to do our final shopping for gifts and food for the 300+ children we are celebrating Christmas with in the next 4 days. 
 

 Then we will spend the night in the hotel to pack all the gifts into portions (1 for every child before) before starting our journey to the 1st children cluster about 2.5 hours drive away Northwards tomorrow!
 

 Let's have a jolly good time today!
 

 3rd wave of Volunteers led by our Misson Leader, Bryan David arrived in Yangon safely today at 11am local time!
 

 May the fun begin!
 

 Advance parties have arrived in Yangon in 2 'waves'! Christmas gifts for the children are all hidden in these bags and boxes :)
 

 By tomorrow afternoon, the rest of the team will assemble and do our final preparation!
 

 Stay tune for more updates!
 

 This year marks the 5th year we are organizing our Santa Mission to bring joy to the children in rural part of Myanmar!
 

 Our leader for this year is Bryan (3rd person from the left), who was the 'Santa Claus' during 2018's Santa Mission (see photo) and he will be leading our 12-member team of Singaporean volunteers to Myanmar on 20 December 2019.
 

 Our program will be from 21 Dec 2019 to 25 Dec 2019 and we will be reaching out to about 400 children from 17 children homes as well as about 25 widows over 5 days at the outskirts of Yangon. 
 

 As per tradition, all of us will contribute our own flight tickets, hotel stay and transport expenses to run this program for the children.
 

 At the same time, we aim to raise S$2000 to cover the expenses of this projects which will go into benefiting the children and widows during the program.
 

 A rough breakdown of the expenses:
 

 Christmas Meals (440 pax): S$1100
 Transport for children: S$200
 Christmas Gift: S$500
 Games and Activities: S$200
 

 Christmas is often said to be the Season of Gifting. From presents to love, we often find ourselves mused in preparation of something beautiful for a special someone. This year, why not break the monotony by gifting to a fellow friend in Myanmar?
 

 If you are keen on supporting this program (which will take place in 12 days time), please contact Linus, Mabel, Bryan, Kah Seng or PM us on this Facebook page.

39,2019,Appreciation Gathering GVH,Miscellanous,Appreciation Gathering,"Quote of the Day: 
 

 ""If you can't feed a hundred people, then feed just one.""
 

 This morning, our 1st ever appreciation gathering of GVH contributors and volunteers took place at Toa Payoh Central, Singapore between 10am and 1pm. 
 

 Joseph, our Project Director from Myanmar, arrived in Singapore a few hours before the event at about 1am early morning to join in the gathering.
 

 He delivered a speech on behalf of all children, villagers and schools with his words of thanks to the contributors before sharing some valuable experience he gathered while leading the various GVH projects in Myanmar on the ground.
 

 Linus, our GVH Leader, shared some of his stories related to the founding of GVH, how he met Joseph and interesting stories he gathered while venturing to remote places in Myanmar and his cross-cultural interactions with them. 
 

 Kaezel, our Finance leader, shared our fund projection for year 2020 while Kah Seng, our Fund raising IC, shared his reason for volunteering in GVH and how he would like to achieve our overall fund target of S$130,000 in 2020 to support all our existing projects in education, necessities and sustainability (See photo for details)
 

 We would like to express our heart-felt gratitude to all our friends who have contributed to our projects for the past 6 years in terms of funds, time, energy and expertise so that the less privileged children could have better access to education and better learning environment, and the villagers in remote places could have better access to water, electricity and shelter.
 

 We look forward to more partnership in 2020 as one GVH community and create more beautiful moments for the beneficiaries.
 

 The date of our 2nd contributor gathering will be announced on a later date.",,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1201987263327702,,,,,,

In Dec 2019, 47 sacks of rice were distributed to 20 homes for children and widows. Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Dec 2019. Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks Mother Bosom: 2 sacks Lawknu Home: 1 sack Bethel Home: 3 sacks Widow Home: 2 sacks Love & Mercy: 2 sacks Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks Faith Home: 2 sacks Noble Home: 2 sacks Canaan Home: 4 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 2 sacks Home of Light: 2 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 2 sacks New Hope Home: 3 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 1 sack Grace Care Children Home: 0 sack Bethlehem-II Children Home: 2 sacks Background Information: These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas. Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables. We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet. While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved. Since Nov 2014, a total of 1957 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors. The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint: Crown Orphanage: 188 sacks Ebenezer Home: 193 sacks Mother Bosom: 179 sacks Grace Home: 79 sacks Canaan Home: 135 sacks Faith Home: 123 sacks Lawknu Home: 89 sacks Boarding School: 2 sacks Widow Homes: 85 sacks Bethel Home: 150 sacks Hope Home: 3 sacks Love & Mercy: 90 sacks Lighthouse Home: 130 sacks Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks Noble Home: 62 sacks Htun (Eagle) Home: 64 sacks Abundant Life Home: 56 sacks Emmenuel Home: 55 sacks GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 35 sacks (+ 80 pkts of milk powder + 27 tins of baby food) Home of Light: 19 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 13 sacks New Hope Home: 16 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 7 sacks Grace Care Children Home: 6 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 6 sacks Grace Refuge: 1 sack Mercy Home: 4 sacks Home in Kachin: 2 sacks Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015) Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes) Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019) As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share. Thank you for supporting our 'Rice for Hope' initiative! The GVH Team.

 We will be spreading these sacks of rice over a period of 8 - 12 months so that our rice provision can be more consistent to the beneficiaries.

 We are pleased to share that the construction process is now underway! 
 

 The bricks took a while to arrive at the school as the terrain was too soft and muddy due to frequent raining in this village for the truck to travel on so we waited for a few days.
 

 We will share more updates once we have reached another significant milestone.
 

 We are glad to share that after a month of fund raising, we are now ready to start the building process! 
 

 Our Myanmar Team led by Joseph started buying materials yesterday and the items are starting to be delivered today together with the team of local villagers who stay near the school.
 

 One major challenge that the team is facing is the muddy road condition. As shared in the video, the road makes it very hard to deliver the material. We used 3 wheeler at first. Then we had to transfer the material to a farming tractor to continue the journey along the wet farmland. Then nearing the school, motorcyclists will transfer the bags of cement portion by portion to eventually arrive at the school.
 

 We are heartened by spirit of the local villagers. People who saw us along the way just volunteered themselves to help us to push the vehicles or carry things. 
 

 Due to road and weather conditions, we had to wait for the perfect window to appear before we could send the materials. As of this writing, other materials like bricks, metals etc are still on their way. 
 

 We are also pleased to share that about 25% - 30% of the required funds are sponsored by the local people such as the school teachers and parents of the children from the school. Their contributions will be used to fund the cost of food for all helpers and also manpower cost to hire their own labourers and builders. Funds from GVH and our sponsors will be used to cover mainly the cost of material and cost of operations. 
 

 We are much encouraged by the enthusiasm of the local community to want to improve the toilet situation for their children and students and our team in GVH is proud to be able to support them.

48,2019,[22nd Water Project],Necessities,Water Supply,"We are pleased to share that this mechanical water well, which is now serving the children and villagers of Kyuat Ka Din Village and School, is now officially completed! 
 

 We have first reached drinkable water on 2 September 2019 after drilling to a depth of 450 feet. While testing the well for a few weeks, we realised that electric power in the school was rather weak which resulted in water coming out much slower than expected. As such, the school temporarily installed a diesel engine to pump water out while the electricians continued to rectify the electric power issues. 
 

 As of today, we are satisfied with the outcome of this project thus we mark it as a successful closure with a symbolic 'ceremony' of handling over the acknowledgement plate to the school principal.
 

 We thank Terence Chiew, his friends and WSQ Diploma In Tourism (SPA) Batch 1 students for their partnership in enabling the 45 school children and 20 families nearby the school to have convenient access to drinkable water in many years to come.",Kyuat Ka Din Village and School,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1155568704636225,,,,,,

In addition, the construction of the first water well in Kune Yawr Village has been successful! The team in Myanmar dug 120 feet into the ground and managed to obtain fresh water! How refreshing!
 

 This is the 1st of 2 water wells which we will be building for this project which is located in this cluster known as PalukNyunt.
 

 The caregiver of this well is by the name of Daw Tin Tin Khine who has been sharing her own limited water resources to the poorer Burmese immigrant workers in this village when we first got to know her.
 

 Touched by her kind heart, we decided to build this water well for this cluster and she has gladly agreed to take care of this water well and continue to serve water to about 40 families as well as the immigrant workers staying nearby.
 

 We thank her for the inspiration and being such good role model for others.
 

 Our exploration has taken us to Kune Yawr Village which is approximately an 1.5 hours drive from the airport, followed by a 3 mins boat ride and a final 10 mins ride by bike. 
 

 There is no electricity in this area and villagers currently have to walk 20 minutes to the lake in order to collect water for their household usage. Therefore, we propose to build 2 hand water pumps to help benefit these 30 families. This will help ease their travellling time in collecting water. 
 

 Please note that these water pumps will be built on privately owned land. Thankfully, the land owners are more than gracious enough to share water extracted from the pumps with these villagers. 
 

 The total cost to construct two manual well wells will approximately be S$600 (materials and operations cost included).
 

 Any reader interested in supporting this project, please PM Linus or send us a message on FB.

Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Oct 2019. Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks Mother Bosom: 3 sacks Lawknu Home: 0 sack Bethel Home: 3 sacks Widow Home: 2 sacks Love & Mercy: 2 sacks Lighthouse Home: 3 sacks Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks Faith Home: 2 sacks Noble Home: 2 sacks Canaan Home: 4 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 3 sacks Home of Light: 2 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 2 sacks New Hope Home: 3 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 1 sack Grace Care Children Home: 1 sack Bethlehem-II Children Home: 1 sacks Background Information: These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas. Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables. We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet. While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved. Since Nov 2014, a total of 1863 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors. The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint: Crown Orphanage: 180 sacks Ebenezer Home: 185 sacks Mother Bosom: 175 sacks Grace Home: 79 sacks Canaan Home: 127 sacks Faith Home: 119 sacks Lawknu Home: 88 sacks Boarding School: 2 sacks Widow Homes: 81 sacks Bethel Home: 144 sacks Hope Home: 3 sacks Love & Mercy: 86 sacks Lighthouse Home: 124 sacks Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks Noble Home: 58 sacks Htun (Eagle) Home: 60 sacks Abundant Life Home: 52 sacks Emmenuel Home: 51 sacks GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 31 sacks (+ 80 pkts of milk powder + 27 tins of baby food) Home of Light: 15 sacks Emmanuel-II Home: 8 sacks New Hope Home: 10 sacks Bethel-II Children Home: 5 sacks Grace Care Children Home: 5 Bethlehem-II Children Home: 3 sacks Grace Refuge: 1 sack Mercy Home: 4 sacks Home in Kachin: 2 sacks Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015) Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes) Mon State: 20 sacks (Flood Relief 2019) As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so.

 We are much encouraged by the spontaneity and eagerness of the local villagers who partnered us by contributing their time and effort to collect and transport sand as well as building the water tank by themselves. The local family who agreed to be the guardian of this well also went the extra mile by contributing food to the people involved in this project. We are certainly privileged to have the chance to work with these wonderful beneficiaries who are so willing to work hard to improve their own lives.
 

 Lastly, we thank the employees of Surbana Jurong Myanmar for their financial support for the material and operation cost of this water well projects!

55,2019,[23rd Water Project],Necessities,Water Supply,"Our exploration brought us to the village of Warrdama of La Kune Pyin cluster where we got to know 60 local families who were deprived of clean water as a manual water well they depended on could no longer work. The villagers in this area often struggle to make ends meet, be it in obtaining clean water, electricity or in the aspect of education. 
 

 We have since reached out and are aiding them in these areas. For a start, we will be helping them solve their water issue.
 

 Currently, the local villagers obtain water by using their roof as water catchment and draining rain water into a container (see photo). This method is only effective during the rainy season. During dry seasons, the villagers have to obtain water either by manually pumping water from the ground which often dries up or fetch water from distances away from other nearby villages. 
 

 Recently, they thought of a way which is to rent diesel powered motors and compressor from a nearby village to pump water up from their own manual well which they said worked very well. However, as the owner of the engine also needs it to pump water in their own village, the villagers of Warrdama is unable to use the engine frequently. 
 

 Our impact to this village will involve installing a diesel powered engine with compressor to work with their existing water hole. We have so far tested the method and it worked perfectly! (See photo for the clear water pumped up)
 

 Next, we will build a cement water tank to hold water that is pumped up so that the families can come here to fetch water home for their usage. (Brick purchase has started - See photo)
 

 We have also identified a friendly party, who is a relative of one of the caregivers of our adopted children homes to be in charge of maintaining the continuous functioning of this water well.
 

 As of today, we have already raised enough funds for this water project. However, we are currently still raising funds to construct a toilet facility for a primary school. As of this writing, we are 50% to our target. Please have a look at this link for more details:

58,2019,Parenting & Education Workshop 2019,Education,Training and Development,"The successful conclusion of the 3rd GVH Continuous Learning Workshop!
 

 This afternoon, Michelle shared (translated by Joseph) with the caregivers issues related to discipline while upbringing their children as well as the various parenting style. She shared the concept of 'Thinking', 'Feeling' and 'action' and how caregivers could enhance relationship with their children by making changes to them.
 

 Michelle engages the audience through role playing, group discussion and also to encourage participants to share their thoughts and feelings segment after segment. 
 

 Laughter continues to fill the air as the session continues.
 

 It's lunch time! Special thanks to the paster of this seminar room and his family for preparing such wonderful lunch for all of us.
 

 After lunch, 2 of the caregivers from Eagle Home and Bethel Home performed a duet for us before we get back to 'study mode' for afternoon session.
 

 We kick start our 3rd run of GVH Continuous Learning Workshop this morning with a simple breakfast for all caregivers followed by Linus's sharing (translated by Zaw Zaw) on the purpose and different modes of education. 
 

 The caregivers are engaged in interactive discussions about the education culture in Myanmar, how education and skill levels are perceived outside of Myanmar and the importance of the caregivers' involvement in providing the right conditions for their children to grow.
 

 We are encouraged by the active participation of the caregivers this morning and their eagerness to ask questions and openness to look issues on different perspectives.
 

 Tomorrow, 11 Sept 2019, we will be holding the 3rd run of our GVH Continuous Learning Workshop for 23 caregivers of various children Homes we are supporting in Myanmar.
 

 This initiative started in December 2018 with the intention to share useful knowledge and tips in the areas of parenting, education, technology, business and so on with the goal of upgrading the caregivers to better guide and take care of their adopted children.
 

 Today, our parenting trainer, Michelle, paid a visit to 2 children homes as part of her preparation for the workshop tomorrow to better understand how much have improved since our 1st workshop in Decemeber 2018 and the thoughts and feelings of the children. 
 

 This workshop will be conducted by Linus and Michelle and translated by Joseph and Zaw Zaw.

59,2019,[Improve Children Well-being Part 5- Mother Bosom Home],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We have been supporting the good work of Joshua, caregiver of Mother Bosom Home for 4 years now. 
 

 Recently, the home managed to secure their own piece of land and built their own humble house with whatever resources and material they can buy or borrow. As such, they no longer need to pay for monthly rental fee to stay in a rented home anymore.
 

 This decision to shift to a new place was also motivated by the fact that the rental price of their rented home went up from S$150/mth to S$200/mth and also the caregiver has sustained a physical injury due to a traffic accident which resulted in his inability to continue his job to support the running cost of the rental. Inevitably, the shift also resulted in a drop in standard of living for the children. The once concrete and cemented 2-storey home has given way to a single floor house built on wood, zinc and bamboo. We are however, encouraged by the children's supportiveness towards their caregiver's decision and learnt to adapt to a new living environment fast.
 

 During our visit, we got to know that the home faces water leakage issue into their home during rainy weather which is especially serious during this 4-month monsoon season which is happening now.
 

 Our team decided to join force with the caregiver to do some basic water proofing work to the 4 walls of the home.
 

 In addition, we have lent a solar panel, inverter and controller to them and they have bought their own battery so that the children now have light at night to study.
 

 Apart from these, we have also supplied 2x study tables for these children to study and eat at.
 

 We thank our supporters for contributing to this 'Improve Children Well-being' mini project.
 

 This is Part 5 of 5 homes we are impacting through this project which has now concluded.
 

 We will continue to monitor these homes and continue to impact the lives of these less privileged children as they progress towards becoming a useful member of society and their families.",Mother Bosom Home,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1118636121662817,,,,,,
60,2019,[Improve Children Well-being Part 4/5 - Grace Children Home],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"When we 1st met this home in June 2019, they do not have a name to identify themselves. After some thinking through, the couple of the family age 38 and 25 decided to name this home 'Grace Children Home'. 
 

 Among the 6 children they look after, 4 of them are from broken family while the other 2 were displaced due to civil war. These 6 children are from Chin State, Rakhine state and Shwepyitha. 
 

 The motivation behind this caregiver comes from his own childhood. He is orphaned at a young age and consequently, he wasn't able to progress well in education. He understood the importance of educating youth thus when he got to know these children over the last 5 years, he felt a sense of duty to take care of them and give them a chance to receive an education for their brighter future.
 

 The family expense was largely supported by the brother of the caregiver who worked in Malaysia from 2014 - 2018. Ever since the brother ended his work in 2018 and returned back to Myanmar, the financial support stopped. As such, the caregiver just supports these children himself through his own salary working as a pastor in a local church and through random donations. The family monthly income is about S$150.
 

 These children are between the age of 5 and 15. 2 of them dreamt to become doctors, another 2 want to become engineers, another 1 want to be a school teacher and the youngest one wants to be a writer.
 

 We thank our supporters for contributing to this 'Improve Children Well-being' mini project.
 

 We have supplied 2x round tables for these children to study and eat at, carpet to lay on the cement floor, 2 mosquito nets and 3 sleeping mats for the children to sleep with.
 

 These children will also be benefiting from our monthly Rice for Hope program and we look forward to support them the basic needs to aid them in their education journey.

 This home is also currently in our Rice for Hope program where we provide monthly sacks of rice for them to cater to their food needs. 
 

 We got to know them in June 2019 through a friendly referral from one of our existing homes. These 6 children are either orphans or they have lost 1 of their parents. They are originally from either the Paletwa township or Rakhain state.
 

 A brief history of this home is that about 2 years ago, U Ye Soe, 38, and his wife happened to know 1 child who is in need of foster care which they eventually adopted. Over time, more request for help came to them. With the heart to provide needy children with shelter, food and education, the couple accepted a child after another. Today, they are taking care of a total of 6. 
 

 When asked what his hope for these children are, he shared that he hoped that these orphans and children from broken family could eventually do well enough to get a university degree so that they could also help children who have less opportunity.

 We got to know this home in June 2019 during our exploration. The caregiver started taking care of children in his own house because of his passion to help orphans and nurture them to be valuable leaders of the nation.
 

 The caregiver does not have a stable job. He works on a free lance basis buying and selling Yam, doing land brokerage and preaching which earns him a monthly income of about S$200.
 

 The family expenses to pay for food, transport and education is about $550. The shortfall is somewhat covered by one of the grown up children from his home who is working now and from his friends on an ad hoc basis. 
 

 The caregiver does not own the land the home occupies but he is working towards buying over the land over time by paying for it a little at a time.

 Purchase and Drilling:
 https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1112764178916678
 

 Manual drilling of the water hole has started today at Kyaut Ka Din village primary school. As of tonight, 220 feet has been reached while our target is to hit about 450 feet. 
 

 In case you are wondering, how we measure the depth of the hole, we did it by measuring the length of the pipe that is drilled downwards into the soil.
 

 The essential equipment and materials have been purchased. We pray for good weather in this unpredictable wet season. 
 

 We will report again when we reached a significant milestone.
 

 About 2 hours drive from Yangon northwards, we came by a primary school is the village of Kyaut Ka Din which teaches 45 children from kindergarten to Grade 5. This school has been around for the past 20 years and it enrolls children in this community of 88 families.
 

 Several years back, an NGO built a large underground water tank (see photo) for them to capture rain water which usually will be used up in the hot and dry summer. A square 'manhole' was also built (see photo) for people to access and clean the tank.
 

 About 20 families who stay nearby the school also depend on capturing rain water from the roof of their houses into their containers for their usage. Similarly, they also face water shortage issues during the hot and dry summer season. 
 

 About 15 - 20 minutes walk away, there is another mechanical community water well which was built by another charitable group several years back. In desperate situation, the villagers nearby this school will attempt to get water from that water point. However, the villagers shared that although that deep water well is able to pump drinkable water all year round (even in dry and hot season), there is simply not enough water to supply to all 88 families in this community. There are also times when the engine to the water pump breaks down and supply of water stopped for several days until the engine was repaired. 
 

 After our interaction with the school principals and local villagers, we felt that it is a worthy cause to build a 2nd deep water well in this village which runs on engine.
 

 This water well will be constructed in the school premise. As such, the school principal and teachers will be in charge of maintaining this water well. 
 

 Water that is pumped up from this well can be stored into the existing large water tank to serve the teacher and students in school. The school has also agreed to allow access to this water well to the 20 families staying nearby the school to cater to their water need. 
 

 As there is already a successful community water well in this village, we are positive that our new water well will be able to tap drinkable water that can serve the community all year round, including the dry and hot season. In addition, the school has electric assess thus the engine can run on electricity instead of diesel. 
 

 Currently, our estimate is that the water hole we are digging will be at least 450 feet in depth (or about 30 floors deep).
 

 The digging process for this water well will start today! 
 

 We would like to thank Terence and his students and friends once again to sponsor the this water well.
 

 If anyone is keen to support more of our future water wells project, please PM us on Facebook or contact Linus directly so that we could continue to bring fresh water to schools and villagers in the rural part of the world.

65,2019,[Improving Children Well-being: Part 1/5],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We have improved the study and eating environment of 14 children (11 orphans, 3 poor) from Emmanuel Children Home by supplying them with 4 full sized tables. This will give the children a proper place to eat and study instead of having to sit and squat on the floor to do so. 
 

 We recently got to know this home in June 2019 and since then, through our Rice for Hope program, we have been providing 2 sacks of rice (100kg in total) to the children in this home on a monthly basis.
 

 Just to share a little background about this home.
 

 The couple of the family, U Ha Thang, 55 and Daw Bu Leng, 54, started taking care of needy children from Chin state in 2008 together with some founding partners. Later on, the partners decided to drop out from the work. Reluctant to just send the children away to other homes or back to their villages, the couple decided to continue the work themselves despite facing challenges to make ends meet. 
 

 Fortunately, along the way, with ad hoc supports from their friends, they were able to own a small piece of farmland in Taikyi area, located about 3 hours north from Yangon downtown, where they set up their permanent children home. In addition, a church based in Singapore has once supported the running cost of the home too.  
 

 When we first met them in June 2019, they share that they do not have consistent sponsors and that the support from the Singaporean church has also concluded. 
 

 The couple currently earns about S$150 a month through their own farming work and the children at home also consume vegetable grown from their own farm.
 

 The hope the couple have for these 14 children is that one day after receiving proper education, they will bring about positive changes and development in their own region and home town.
 

 Our team will continue to supply the children with rice on a monthly basis, improve the learning environment for the children and also to support their education in the coming years.

66,2019,[Let's build a new toilet together!],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"Our exploration brought us to Zawel Wu Government School where 132 students from kindergarten to Grade 7 level study at.
 

 We are currently looking at building a new toilet facility for the school as their existing toilet has already become unusable due to the collapse of the waste pit below the toilet. The waste pit was originally dug without any reinforcement done to its interior walls thus over time the soil eroded and fell.
 

 In an effort to solve this problem, the local villagers did what they could by digging temporary holes in the ground with basic bamboo structure over it. Once the holes are filled, they will cover the holes by soil again before digging at a new place. 
 

 As there are 132 children and everyone uses the school toilet everyday after having breakfast at home, we felt that these temporary toilets may lead to potential problems like hygiene and spreading of diseases. This is especially a concern during the 4-month rainy season (July - Oct) where heavy downpour can easily cause flooding, resulting in waste content of these temporary pit to 'overflow' and be washed to other areas in the school. 
 

 To tackle this problem, we propose the construction of a new proper toilet with 4 cubicles - 2 for boys and 2 for girls. This toilet will be built with cement walls, zinc roof and with enough openings for ventilation. The large waste pit will also be reinforced with cement walls to minimise the chance of collapsing and a water point will be fixed nearby to wash the toilet. We believe this new 4-cubicle toilet will serve the school for more than 10 years.
 

 Together with the local villagers, we have also worked out the estimated cost of material, manpower and operations which amounted to SGD$2200.00 (or S$550 per cubicle)
 

 We are also heartened by the community spirit of this village because many of the local villagers have come forward to offer help both in terms of pooling microfunds together and in terms of offering manpower to buy and transport the building materials by hand. The persistent heavy rain in this monsoon season has made road access to this school tougher than usual and it is likely that we will need to use boats to transport materials instead of trucks. Nevertheless, the local community is looking forward to joining forces with us to complete this project for the benefits of the teachers and children they love.
 

 We will be doing an internal fund raising for this project and if you are keen to co-sponsor this project, please PM us to contact Linus directly.",Zawel Wu Government School,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1108239552702474,,,,,,

68,2019,[To Improve Children's Well-Being],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"Studying and eating on the floor, dodging leaking water from the roof, sleeping on hard floors and cramping in a mosquito net describe the living conditions of some of the orphans and children in the villages we recently got to know.
 

 Over the past few weeks, our exploration efforts brought us to 4 new families in the less developed part of Myanmar who take care of needy children. 
 

 In addition, one of the families we have been helping for a few years now, Mother Bosom Home, has recently moved from their rented home to a new piece of land owned by themselves. Although such move allows them to skip the need to pay monthly rental fee, the children they are helping have to get used to a new living environment which is lower in living standard.
 

 The caregivers of these 5 families, are not financially stable themselves but did the best they could to provide shelter and an opportunity for the village children (mostly orphans and from broken families) to attend schools in Yangon. 
 

 Their hope for these children are similar - to give them a chance to be better educated for a better life in future.
 

 We are currently looking at a few ways to slightly improve the standard of living of these children. Some ways are as follow:
 

 1) Supply enough study benches or tables for the children so that they have sufficient space to study on the tables instead of on the floor for better body posture. These tables may be used as dining tables too!
 

 2) Expand their sleeping space by supplying mosquito nets and sleeping mattresses / or mats and also to separate boys and girls sleeping areas.
 

 3) Patch leaking roofs by using canvas to drain rain water to the side of the house. This is especially crucial as it's now the rainy monsoon season. 
 

 4) Supply enough carpets for the floor to give extra warm and comfort for the children. 
 

 These are some simple ways to enhence the well-being of these children. 
 

 The estimated cost to complete these improvement work for the children in these 5 homes is SGD$1000.00.

 In Aug 2019, 51 sacks of rice, 4 tins of baby food and 3 pkts of baby powder are distributed to 20 homes for children and widows. Among the children homes, 2 of them, namely 'Grace Care Children Home' and 'Bethel-II Children Home' are homes we have recently gotten in touch with. 
 

 For these 2 new homes, we have supplied them 2 sacks of rice each in the mid of July (after the Rice Update in July) thus these 4 sacks of rice are added into this August 2019 tally.
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Aug 2019.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 3 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 1 sack
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 1746 sacks of rice, 80 packets of milk powder and 27 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 172 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 178 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 169 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 119 sacks

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.

71,2019,[School Project],Sustainability,Infrastructure,"We are pleased to share that the new stairway for Pinneal Gone Elementary school is now completed! 
 

 We thank the school principal for her partnership in overseeing the building process together with us, the builders for going the extra mile to work on the stairs despite the rain and delay as well as our sponsor for funding this mini project. 
 

 The stairway is mainly built using brick, cement and blue water pipes which add as support handles. 
 

 The earlier post for this project can be found here:
 https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1089993824527047&id=375770749282695
 

 The principal of Pinneal Gone Elementary school at Hmawbi township recently raised a concern she had about the safety of the children in her school. She shared that traffic outside the school is increasing over the years and vehicles are also travelling faster. There is only 1 small entry/exit point for the school which all 100+ children and staff use. Although no traffic accident has ever occurred, the principal would like to address this potential danger for her pupils and prevent any accident from happening.
 

 After some discussion with the principal, we decided that it is better for the school to have a 2nd entry/exit point, which is linked to another road that is wider and less traffic density. Apart from potential road accident, we also feel that the existing entry/exit point of the school is too small (see video). In the event there is a need to evacuate the school population, 1 small exit point also post a risk for the children as well.
 

 We are glad to share that the stairway contraction is now underway.

 After 4 years, the well is still in working condition, serving the local villagers nearby. However, the old engine pump has already weakened, so the guardian of the well bought a new engine to continue pumping water up. He continues to support the price of fuel as far as possible to operate the machine pump till date so that the villagers nearby including his own home could continue to have water supply.

 ""Education is not the filling of a pot but the lighting of a fire.” - W.B. Yeats
 

 May the fire torch in them burn ever with fervency.
 

 This afternoon the caregivers of various children homes gathered with us at the home of Zaw Zaw to repack and boxes of education material into pre-determined portions per home. 
 

 These materials are sponsored by friends of the GVH Community into the 'GVH Bursary Fund' which will supply essential education material to all the children in our umbrella of care for 1 academic year (June 2019 - March 2020) 
 

 Today's distribution is just part 1 of the 2-part plan for the children.
 

 We will distribute education material again in November 2019. 
 

 We thank you for playing a part in helping the children in their educational journey. These are children from the villages who are either orphans or children from broken families. We hope that through education, their lives will eventually change for the better.

83,2019,[21st Water Project],Necessities,Water Supply,"In the peaceful village of Tin Zone, there is a cluster of about 70 families who have been staying in this area for 15 years. 
 

 5 of the families here have their own private water wells which they share with their neighbours from time to time. However as years go by, the villagers realised that it became harder and harder to extract water from the wells especially in the hot and dry season.
 

 Nearby this slum, there are plantations owned by wealthier people. When the villagers ran out of water, they would attempt to plead for water from the workers in these plantations. However, such way of getting water is not consistent and they also wish not to keep asking for water all the time. 
 

 Just like any other slums, people here work odd jobs for a living and building their own water wells are not readily affordable for them. The cost of a water well can be about 3 months their household income.
 

 After interacting with the villagers for a while, we decided to lend a small helping hand by installing a community water well for them. The leader of the cluster will be in charge of it to maintain the well in working condition and everyone will share the well. The well is dug deeper in hope that it could continue to supply the villagers with water even during the hot and dry season.
 

 We are planning to build 2 such wells for Tin Zone but we just build 1 for now to assess its performance.
 

 If anyone is keen to sponsor a 2nd well here in the event we are satisfied with the performance of the 1st well, do leave us a message through Facebook or contact Linus.",Village of Tin Zone,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1062470207279409,,,,,,

 Today caregivers of various children homes we are partnering with gathered at the market to purchase new sets of school uniforms for the children in our umbrella of care. 
 

 This is the 4th year we are distributing school uniforms to the children from the villages at the start of the new school year. We got to know that this year, the schools are not providing 1 set of free uniform to their students anymore. As such, the children will only be receiving 1 new set of school uniform from us and also reuse the old uniforms from previous years.

85,2019,GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 55th month since Nov 2014,Necessities,Rice for Hope,"GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 55th month since Nov 2014! In June 2019, 44 sacks of rice are distributed to 16 homes for children and widows and 2 packets of milk powder + 4 tins of Baby Food to Bawathit Children Home.
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in June 2019.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 3 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 3 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 1 sack
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks
 Widow Home: 2 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 3 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 4 sacks
 Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks
 Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks 
 Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 3 sacks
 Faith Home: 3 sacks
 Noble Home: 3 sacks
 Canaan Home: 3 sacks 
 Bawahthit Children Home: 3 sacks + 2 pkts of milk powder + 4 tins of baby food
 Home of Light: 2 sacks
 

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 1647 sacks of rice, 77 packets of milk powder and 23 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 165 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 170 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 162 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 111 sacks
 Faith Home: 110 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 85 sacks
 Boarding School: 2 sacks
 Widow Homes: 73 sacks
 Bethel Home: 132 sacks
 Hope Home: 3 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 77 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 111 sacks
 Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks
 Noble Home: 50 sacks
 Htun (Eagle) Home: 51 sacks 
 Abundant Life Home: 44 sacks 
 Emmenuel Home: 43 sacks
 GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks 
 Bawahthit Children Home: 20 sacks + 77 pkts of milk powder + 23 tins of baby food
 Home of Light: 7 sacks 
 Grace Refuge: 1 sack
 Mercy Home: 4 sacks
 Home in Kachin: 2 sacks
 Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack
 Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks
 Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015)
 Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes)
 

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.
 

 Thank you for supporting our 'Rice for Hope' initiative!
 

 The GVH Team.

89,2019,Exploration/ 'discovery' of the Phui Waterfall,Miscellanous,Exploration,"The highlight of our exploration is the 'discovery' of the Phui Waterfall located about 1 hour jeep away from Zuitui and a 30 minutes trek up and down the mountainous terrain. 
 

 This waterfall is currently not on the Google map and we got to know it through a native dweller, Obed Thang Ha, a long time friend of GVH. 
 

 The waterfall is not commercialised and it's rather challenging to reach for urban dwellers who have little trekking experience as the trail is not purposely made easier for tourist to visit. At several points, all 4 limbs and good balancing skills are needed to cross the obstacles. But it's all worth it when we finally see the waterfall in pristine condition. 
 

 We were told that during the rainy season (July - Oct), the waterfall will be much more powerful. Thus November might be the best time to come here to see it and the temperature will also be colder at about 10 degree. 
 

 I think it has been a privilege that we are the rare few foreign visitors who get to experience this beautiful waterfall and we will surely come back here again with our friends in future.
 

 A couple of things we, the Singaporean visitors, were surprised to see today during the exploration.
 

 1) We came by 4 kids sitting along the roadside selling their home made wine and strawberries from their family farm. They just sat there and waited. They are skilled in counting money.
 

 2) A 12-year-old boy from Zuitui riding a motorcycle himself while he wasn't tall enough to sit on the seat yet. What a life skill to have at this age!
 

 3) A little boy pumping petrol into our bike using his shoulder. The shop actually has a petrol vending machine now and no longer selling by bottles anymore.
 

 4) A carpet of houseflies waiting for their turn to eat. Seriously! After we ate our food, they became more active 'as a family', swarming at the leftovers. This photo was taken just beside we started eating.
 

 5) A dead green snake spotted on a rock beside the waterfall we visited. Heard that it's poisonous and may cause death if bitten by it.
 

 6) Strawberries farm with strawberries grown on the ground. I think many of us have the impression that strawberry farm tend to grow strawberries in pots. 
 

 7) Eating Mint leave raw! I am sure not many people have done that before. It really tastes like Mentos. Add those leaves into hot water and it feels superb! 
 

 It is really interesting to see the way of lives of people in the rural part of the world. Things that we find dangerous or unusual are normal to them. 
 

 This exploration is eye-opening and tend us slightly towards being more globally competent. 
 

 Exploration started today at 7.30am local time on this jeep we hired. We got to know of a waterfall about 1 hour by jeep and 30min by tracking from our location which we will recce today together with other places.
 

 One thing I am pleasantly surprised is the much better internet connectivity now in this mountainous region. 
 

 Things are really improving step by step in this region.
 

 After 1.5 years, the GVH Team is now back to the mountain top village of Zuitui in Chin State to carry on with the tourism sustainability project after a 16-hour journey on the road from Yangon.
 

 The tree house still looks great after all these years and the village is now installed with solar powered street lamp! The road we helped widened back in 2016 is still in good condition and survived 3 rainy seasons so far.
 

 The latest addition to this village is a new premise for the Christ of Church which our Brother Bu Kee just got married with Moe Moe Nwe in this morning. We are fortunate to be able to arrive just in time to join in the wedding lunch in the new church to celebrate this joyous occasion with them. 
 

 This tree house was constructed with the goal of providing short term lodging for bagpackers who wants to enjoy the majestic view of the mountain range and star gaze at night while staying in a peaceful village near the top of the mountain. 
 

 This project therefore aims to eventually help boost the income of the villagers of Zuitui. 
 

 Our team will be exploring the surrounding natural landscape tomorrow. We will share more updates soon!","Phui Waterfall, Zuitui","https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1049816585211438

91,2019,[Days to Bursary Award Ceremony],Education,Academic Education,"[0.5 day to Bursary] The team running the 4th GVH Bursary Award Ceremony tomorrow! Just completed our 'paper rehearsal' for tomorrow's event at the National Races Village. We will assemble again at 8am (MM time) tomorrow before the children are seated at 10am. We are grateful to everyone who has directly or indirectly assisted in this event for the kids whether is it on stage or at the backstage. Looking forward to share more updates during the event!
 

 We paid a visit to Home of Light Children Home this morning and met up with these 2 boys: A Liverpool fan and a Man-U fan. 
 

 Both of them are in Grade 9 in this new school term but decided not to apply for Bursary Award. Upon a chat with the caregiver, we got to know that both of them have less interest in study but more interest in playing football in hope to play well enough to compete in tournaments. 
 

 We realised that both of them have a soccer ball which is 'broken' and deformed. When we asked them to take a photo together, one of the boys took the ball and tried to shape it back to round shape again.
 

 When we asked them if they are confident to play well enough one day to represent a club, they said that it is unlikely because they do not proper ball and soccer gear.
 

 After a short debrief, we felt that perhaps some work can be done to identify talents in non-academic areas among children who are performing less well in studies but display passion in areas like sports, arts, music and so on. 
 

 After all, success does not belong to only those who can study well. 
 

 We will share more ideas once we have them. 
 

 [2 days to Bursary] This evening, all 4 of us gathered at Yangon for the 1st time to do some last minute packing of Bursary prizes into 60 portions and writing and pasting of words of encouragement from donors into 60 books.
 

 After 3 hours, at about 2am SG time, we are almost done! Not even the frequent blackouts could stop us from finishing the work. =) 
 

 Time to KO for now as we meet the Myanmar team tomorrow for the 'Final Rehearsal'.
 

 [4 days to Bursary!] 40 bursary trophies and 20 excellence medals are now ready for the 4th run of our bursary award ceremony! 
 

 We are grateful to Aries Lim and her family and friends for spending time today to buy the ribbons and tie them onto the trophies to decorate them! 
 

 Special thanks to Mr Ken from Yoonly Enterprise Pte Ltd for the sponsorship of the medals and trophies too!
 

 This is the 1st time that the trophies are prepared in Singapore and also the 1st time that medals will be presented to excellence award winners instead of certificates.
 

 We hope that this will further encourage the children in Myanmar to achieve greater heights in their studies.
 

 [5 more days to Bursary!] Last year, Ng Weihan designed various post cards which were presented to the bursary awardees as gifts. This year, she volunteered to sponsor and design in her own hand drawing 60 unique book covers with motivation messages instead! 
 

 These 60 books will be presented to every bursary and excellence award recipients on 23 May 2019 during the Bursary Award Ceremony. 
 

 Just like last year, we invite all GVH donors and supporters to leave a personal message or words of encouragement for the awardees which we will either write into the 1st page of the book on your behalf (as shown in the sample photo) or if you prefer, to pen your message in your own handwriting, sign off and whatsapp Linus and PM us on Facebook a clear photo of your message. We will print it out and paste it into the books. (Black and White printing only)
 

 Your message has to reach us by 20 May 2019, 2359hr (if printing for you is required) as the Singaporean volunteers will be flying to Myanmar on 21 May 2019. 
 

 We can still pen down your message on your behalf if your message can reach us by 22 May 2019 2359hr. 
 

 The event is on 23 May 2019 morning.
 

 [6 days to Bursary!] We are pleased to announce that these 40 wonderful children from 13 orphanages and foster care families will be awarded with the 2019 GVH Bursary Award on 23 May 2019! 
 

 These children will receive all educational support required for 1 academic year from June 2019 - Feb 2020 in terms of monthly tuition opportunity, education materials and school uniform. 
 

 We hope that with these material support, learning opportunity and their good study attitude, they will continue to excel in their studies and eventually pass their high school exam to qualify for university entrance.

 We would also like to thank all of you who have supported them in last year's Bursary Award Project. Knowing that we have your support means so much as we continue to strive to enhance the lives of the less privileged children in rural part of Myanmar.
 

 [12 days to Bursary 2019] Another 24 nominees from 5 children home of Grade 8 - 10 attended the Bursary Interview and test today. This brings the total number of nominees to 51. 
 

 Application for Bursary is now closed.
 

 In the next 6 days, the Bursary Committee will review their results and aptitude before announcing the winners by 17 May 2019.
 

 Among the winners, the best few performers will be invited to deliver their English speeches on stage during the upcoming bursary award ceremony held at the National Races Village on 23 May 2019. 
 

 We are glad to share that as of today, we are at 56.79% of our targeted funds required to support 300 children in terms of uniform and educational material and 40 children in terms of Bursary support for 1 full year from June 2019 - May 2020.

 1st round of interview and English test started today at Yangon for the 1st Batch of 27 kids from 7 children homes.
 

 The children came prepared with their homework, which is a short English essay about their reflections and goals. 
 

 In these 2 days, we will meet about 58 nominees from Grade 8 - 10 who have the will to do well in their academic studies in 2019/2020 academic year. They will be assessed based on their academic results from last year, recommendations from caregivers and education camp angels, their English proficiency in writing, spoken interaction and speech. 
 

 Something common about these children, are that they are all born in the rural areas of Myanmar and are either orphans, from broken families or from very poor background. 
 

 The goal of GVH Bursary Project is to identify 40 promising ones in terms of study attitude, aptitude and character and offer them a chance to have better guidance in their studies by giving them access to after-school tuition classes, sufficient educational materials and school uniform so as to level the playing field with their peers from more financially well off families. 
 

 This year, apart from sponsoring all 300 children with school uniforms and stationery, we will identify 40 promising grade 8 - 10 kids among the 85 of them in our umbrella of care to be awarded the Bursary Award. 
 

 Winners of the award will have all their academic fees all paid for by our GVH bursary funds directly to the educational institutions and/or tuition teachers from our GVH group.
 

 The selection result will be announced by 17 May 2019 and the Bursary Award Ceremony will be held at the National Races Village on 23 May 2019. 
 

 As of this post, we have achieved 45.26% of our required funds to run this Bursary Program for 1 full year from June 2019 - May 2020.

 Apart from attending the speech and ceremonial event, the children can also get to visit the various traditional houses, furniture, hunting equipment, paintings of various races in Myanmar like Kachin, Kayah, Kayin, Chin, Bamar, Mon, Rakhine and Shan to learn more about the culture and way of life of people of different races from various parts of Myanmar. 
 

 This will be a fresh experience for many of these children as many have never visited this outdoor museum before and we hope to widen their horizons about their own country by bringing them to this location for our bursary event.
 

 As of today, we will invite about 200 children of Grade 4 - 10 children from 16 children homes to join the event in the National Races Village.
 

 Depending on our fund raising outcome, this year, we target to sponsor 40 promising children out of the 250 in our umbrella of care to cover all their educational needs for 1 academic year. 
 

 More detail about our fund raising campaign will be posted on Facebook soon!

In May 2019, 47 sacks of rice are distributed to 16 homes for children and widows and 5 packets of milk powder + 7 tins of Baby Food to Bawathit Children Home.
 

 We also also happy to share that the one and only Baby orphan, Joshua, is now 10-month old and will be starting to eat solid food from next month! As such, this shall be the last month we are supporting baby food to him.
 

 Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in May 2019.
 

 Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 4 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 1 sack
 Bethel Home: 3 sacks
 Widow Home: 2 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 3 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 4 sacks

 Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks 
 Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 3 sacks
 Faith Home: 3 sacks

 Canaan Home: 0 sack (away from home)
 Bawahthit Children Home: 2 sacks + 5 pkts of milk powder + 7 tins of baby food
 Home of Light: 3 sacks
 Mercy Home: 4 sacks 
 

 Background Information:
 These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas.
 

 Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables.
 

 We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet.
 

 While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved.
 

 Since Nov 2014, a total of 1603 sacks of rice, 75 packets of milk powder and 19 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors.
 

 The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint:
 

 Crown Orphanage: 162 sacks 
 Ebenezer Home: 166 sacks
 Mother Bosom: 159 sacks
 Grace Home: 79 sacks
 Canaan Home: 108 sacks
 Faith Home: 107 sacks
 Lawknu Home: 84 sacks
 Boarding School: 2 sacks
 Widow Homes: 71 sacks
 Bethel Home: 129 sacks
 Hope Home: 3 sacks
 Love & Mercy: 74 sacks
 Lighthouse Home: 107 sacks
 Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks
 Noble Home: 47 sacks
 Htun (Eagle) Home: 48 sacks 
 Abundant Life Home: 42 sacks 
 Emmenuel Home: 41 sacks
 GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks 
 Bawahthit Children Home: 17 sacks + 75 pkts of milk powder + 19 tins of baby food
 Home of Light: 5 sacks 
 Grace Refuge: 1 sack
 Mercy Home: 4 sacks
 Home in Kachin: 2 sacks
 Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack
 Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks
 Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015)
 Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes)
 

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.

Education is like the passing of the flame from one person to another which could eventually brighten the world around us. How bright we shine, however, depends on the 'material' we have in us. A fire torch can glow brighter than a candle. Similarly, a fire pit can glow brighter than a torch.

 Tonight, the volunteers of our recently concluded 2019 Education Camp gathered once again in Singapore for a debrief to share learning points and how we could improve the camp in March 2020. Some proposed improvement includes - Having a larger campsite with more toilets and bigger halls for the kids - Having more rest time for the younger children - Less competitive games but more games that promote team work and personal skills - Bigger camp fire with a cannon ball ignition instead of fire torch - More night snacks (the children loved them!) - More volunteers! - Include Science lessons and demonstrations into the camp curriculum Among many more proposed improvements. We look forward to serving again in 2020! At the mean time, we focus on our next major project, which is the Bursary Award Ceremony scheduled to be held on 23 May 2019 at the National Races Village in Yangon.

 *Funds required and status of fund raised below*
 

 New academic year in Myanmar starts in June 2019. Last year, with the support from many of our friends, GVH was able to supply educational necessities like assessment books, stationery, school bags and writing material to 200 children from various homes and orphanages. We were also able to sponsor 30 promising children tuition fees for a year so that they could have a higher chance to eventually pass their high school exam and qualify for university entrance. 
 

 This year, we target to offer bursary award to 40 children (10 more than last year) who have shown tremendous dedication and drive in their studies but was unable to attend tuition classes due to financial constraint of their foster homes. 
 

 We also target to provide 1 extra school uniform and all essential educational materials for 300 children in 17 homes and small villages we adopted over the years.
 

 Last year, ""Our Better World"" featured our 2018 Bursary Award in their short documentary. Have a look at it here!

 Also have a look at this Youtube video for the 2016 and 2017 Bursary Award ceremony

 -----Background story ----
 In Myanmar, education in public schools is free. However children are required to be in their school uniforms and have their own study material before they are allowed and ready to attend the classes. Although many children are provided with 1 new set of uniform from the school, between July and November rainy season, it is common to see children wearing wet uniform to school in the rural community as they may only have that 1 set of uniform for the whole year. Due to limited capital, many foster homes we know could hardly afford to purchase more school uniforms for the children they take care. Some children wear old uniforms which were passed down from the elder children which usually are not in good condition. 
 

 The culture of education in Myanmar is such that students have the mentality that passing the Grade 10 high school exam is their golden ticket to greater success in life. Yet the passing rate in Myanmar remains low (about 20 - 30%), not to mention the passing rate among children in poorer homes and orphanages who could not afford to hire tutors or attend tuition classes. They are unfortunately, at a disadvantage in the educational arena .
 

 ----- How much is it -----
 Estimated price as it differs at different region
 

 1 set of uniform per year (Young Learner): S$5.50
 1 set of uniform per year (Teenage Learner): S$7.50
 

 To cater to 1 child, 1 whole year of educational material (like exercise books and writing material): S$12 per child per year.
 

 Tuition fees
 - In large group classes
 - attend class every day after school
 - hours per days varies, about 6 hours a day on weekends and 4 hours a day on weekdays.
 

 Grade 10 (most important year): S$55.00/mth
 Grade 8 and 9: S$45.00/mth
 

 *Note that price stated may vary.
 

 ----- The Uniform Plan ----- 
 (Target: S$1950 for 300 uniform)
 

 This is calculated based on an average of $6.50 per child. Once again, price may vary.
 

 ---- The Educational Material Plan ----
 (Target: S$3600 for 300 sets)
 

 This is calculated based on $12 worth of exercise books, pens, pencils, erasers, textbooks etc) per child per year.
 

 (Average of $1 per child per month)
 

 ----- The Bursary Plan -----
 (Target: S$18,000 to sponsor 40 children for 1 year tuition fee)
 

 This amount is calculated based on S$50 per month per child over an academic year of 9 – 10 months.
 

 There are 3 categories this year
 

 C1) Grade 10 (Final Year)
 C2) Grade 8 and 9 (High School)
 C3) Part Time University (*New*)
 

 We will invite all children of 17 children home and orphanages in our umbrella of care to apply for the award. We will assess them based on
 

 1) Behavior
 2) Testimonials and Recommendation
 3) English Essay and Oral Test
 4) Current School Results
 

 Winner of the award will be presented with a full year sponsorship of their tuition fees, full year supply of books, stationery and other essential needs to aid in their education.
 

 By our discretion (and available funds), we will offer partial support of tuition fees to those who did not get the bursary award.
 

 We aim to support at least 40 children one full tuition fee sponsorship this year.
 

 As usual, if we could raise more than required funds, we will support more children with their studies in 2019/2020 academic year.
 

 ** Do also note that we do not award cash to the bursary award winners like what we do in Singapore. We pay fees to the education providers directly monthly. This ensures that the money is used for its intended purpose, which is to send the children to attend classes. *
 

 ----- The Simple Award Presentation -----
 It will be held on 23 May 2019 at the National Races Village in Yangon. This location is chosen as the children will get to visit this outdoor museum during the bursary event to learn more about the culture and way of life of the various races in Myanmar to widen their horizons.
 

 Cost of running this event is about $1500.00 in the following breakdown:
 

 1-day Event Hall Rental: $100.00 
 Sound system rental: $50.00
 Entry Ticket ($0.50 per child): $100.00 
 Chair rental: $25.00 
 Transport / Logistic / Material Cost: $600.00
 Packet Lunch ($2.70 per head): $625.00 
 

 Photos of venue here:
 https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1022707984588965
 

 ----- Time Line -----
 By 15 May 2019, we will announce whether we are financially capable to purchase 300 sets of uniform, 300 sets of educational materials and support 40 children for 1 year of education. So this is currently the 1st deadline.
 

 We will announce the result of the bursary by 17 May 2019 and thus by 23 May 2019 we could hold the simple award ceremony whereby Linus and 4 other friends from Singapore will fly in to join force with Joseph and team to conduct the event. (cost of flight and all expenses are self funded)
 

 School and tuition program will officially start first week of June 2018. 
 

 After which, the bursary funds still welcome continuous contribution as along the way, we will still offer help to more children for their educational needs depending on the status of the bursary fund.

 We will update our Facebook page of the status of our fund raising including the names (or alias if preferred to stay anonymous) of donors who have pledge their support.

 As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share.

 The 290 feet deep well and tank now stands proudly in Botelgone school with a tap connected outside of the school for the villagers staying nearby to collect. 
 

 We are surprised and grateful to the funder of this project who decided not to mention a personal name on the water well but a message that reads:

 The children are still hyper active despite the campfire has ended :)
 

 The moment the campfire pit lights up!
 

 Campfire burning bright! Let the songs and dance ring!!!
 

 Campfire ground ready! Thanks to Farid for the great work with the fire pit!
 

 Another long queue moment, this time is Ice Cream! Unlike last year, this year's campsite is at a more rural location so there isn't any Ice cream man on bike. So we went to a shop to place order instead. As such, the ice cream comes in 6 different cans and flavours. 
 

 Scoop after scoop, our volunteers become more skilled. The ice cream gets rounder and founder :)
 

 Most importantly, the children are really enjoying themselves. They don't get to eat food like these in their daily lives. What a day to enjoy good fun and good food at the start of school holiday!
 

 Every year, we took the opportunity to distribute all the pre-loved items or new unused items to the various children home. 
 

 Today, we did the same. All the donated items like clothing and bags collected in 2018 were brought here today. After saying their words of thanks, caregivers of various homes picked items which they believe are suitable for their homes while the children were having their telematches.
 

 We thank all donors for your generosity and volunteers who have helped in the logistics and transportation to make this small Giving process a possible one.
 

 Since 2017, we started presenting 'GVH Honorary Mention Award' on a daily basis to children who have shown exceptional creativity, initiative and leadership during the camp. The intention is to recognise these children while at the same time, serve as an encouragement for everyone to tend towards being more helpful and kind to others. At the same time, we have reminded the children that while they may be awarded for their exceptional good deeds, we should continue to help others with our hearts and not to purposely do it for a prize. 
 

 This morning, we have awarded another 27 children the GVH Honorary Mention Award followed by the Camp Good Job Cheer which sounded like

 After a hearty lunch, the children gathered once again in the afternoon for a 3-hour enrichment and academic program we have prepared for them. 
 

 We divided the children into 4 groups according to their age.
 

 The young kids group (age 6 and younger), are taken care by Michelle Huang who has prepared drawing and action activities suitable for the pre-schoolers. 
 

 The young learner (age 7 - 10) are taken care by Madeline who will conduct basic English and Math related lessons to them.
 

 The young teens (age 11 - 14) which contributes the majority of the children in camp are taken care by Iris who have prepared more advanced English and Maths lessons.
 

 Lastly, the young adults (age 15 and higher) group will attend a series of enrichment workshops prepared by Linus, Mabel, Terence, Kaezel and Jonathon. Topics shared includes being employable, finding purpose in life, how to manage our income and various business models for start-ups. Dhana also made an adhoc appearance to share about her experience in security related topics being a police officer herself.
 

 We are encouraged by the enthusiasm of the children to learn.
 

 Due to the larger group we have this year, we ran 3 activities concurrently. 
 

 A group led by Shannon to learn a song. Some learn the beat, some learn the lyrics and some learn to blow a straw instrument. By end of camp, we will harmonise all parts together into 1, hopefully, beautiful symphony.
 

 A group led by Terence to learn about creativity and diversity through the use of lego bricks.
 

 A group led by Kah Seng plays the watermelon hide and seek, a game apart from the fun, is also meant to hydrate the kids. 
 

 Then the teams will swop in a round robin manner. 
 

 The kids are really having fun while learning.
 

 Before the start of the 1st of many games this morning, the teams made their own flags which they will bring with them to battle :)
 

 Team cheers are ringing in camp right now.
 

 Morning PT was scheduled to start at 6.30am but the children were already gathered around the field in bright spirit at 6am. PT started with light warm up excercises before a fun planking challenge among the teams. We finished the morning workout with the children in high adrenaline, ready for another day of fun and enriching activities ahead.",,"https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/photos/a.376618039197966/1013567298836367/

107,2019,[Days leading to 4th Education and Reflections Camp],Education,Non-academic Education,"[0.5 days to camp!] Last year, Terence Chiew taught the children in camp how to create simple stories using the theme 'Fish and Ocean'. We eventually followed up on the lesson and used the children's 'Fish Story' as one of the selection criteria for last year's bursary project in May 2018.
 

 This year, Terence is back for the 2nd year straight and he has prepared an interesting enrichment lesson to share with the children. The lesson will require children to build things with the learning points of embracing diversity.
 

 After this year's camp, we will be announcing the new bursary award selection criteria for our next Bursary Award project whose ceremony is scheduled to take place on 23 May 2019.
 

 We thanks Terence of www.peetasia.com for his continual support of GVH's educational initiatives.

 [1.5 days before camp!] This afternoon, some caregivers and teenage kids volunteered together with Joseph to do a final campsite tidy up!
 

 The 2019 camp banner is also ready now!
 

 From 25 March 2019, This campsite will be filled with joy and laughter.
 

 [2 days to camp!] Last minute logistic preparation for the Children Education Camp! As this year we have almost doubled the number of volunteers than previous years, we have to prepare more items like mosquito nets, power fan, multiplug and so on. 
 

 Other items we prepared include games items, campfire items, cleaning items, printing of worksheets for the children's lessons and so on.
 

 This year, we tried doing our own in-house worksheet printing instead of printing from shops in Yangon in an effort to save some cost (almost 50% savings) which could be used for other items to benefit the children more. As such Joseph and assistant, N. Borne stayed up almost the entire night yesterday to print the worksheets and printing is still on-going.
 

 All these efforts to give the children a great time in camp starting on Monday, 25 March 2019.
 

 [3 days to camp!] This year, we will be bringing 'Instant Photo Booth' to the camp for the 1st time! This is made possible by Esther Wong and Penguin Photography who will be serving in the camp as volunteers.
 

 We are grateful to them for their generous sponsorship of technology, equipment, expertise and photo papers necessary to make this new experience possible for the children in Myanmar. 
 

 We look forward to sharing more update real soon!
 

 [4 more days to camp!] Our camp banner since 2016! We have different theme every year. 2016 - Education & Health 2017 - Education & Inspiration 2018 - Education & Creativity This year, our theme is 'Education & Reflections'. We hope we could embark with the children through a self discovery and self reflection journey while having lots of fun learning together! We look forward to share more real time photo updates between 25 and 28 March 2019! Thank you for following our journey!
 

 [5 more days to camp!] One thing we are doing differently in this year's camp is the food arrangement. In our past 3 camps (2016 - 2018), food is cooked by our internal team of caregivers of various children home. This year, we are working with an external team of food caterer. The key advantage is that we will be able to bring different types of food for the children which they seldom eat at home.
 

 We are looking forward to food like Chicken rice, Biryani, Shan traditional noodle and more!
 

 Seen in this photo is Joseph with the Chief Chef of the catering team and we are grateful to her for agreeing to set up a temporary cooking base nearby the campsite to add to the convenience of providing 3 meals a day for the camp population. 
 

 We are once again glad to be working with the same soy milk supplier to supply bottles of fresh soy milk for all the children daily during the camp. This year, one thing different is that they will also be providing ice boxes to keep the soy milk chill to prolong their life shell. 
 

 There are many more fresh food-related initiative we are preparing for this year's camp and we look forward to share more about them during the actual camp 25 - 28 March 2019.
 

 Thank you so much for following our stories!
 

 [7 more days to Camp!] Last gift item for the kids in Myanmar received today! 
 

 These 'Light Sticks' hand band will be used during the inaugural GVH campfire night on 27 March 2019. Hopefully these will illuminate the night more beautifully as the children sing-a-long around the campfire that night. 
 

 These night sticks are contributed by Ng Weihan and her JC friends who used part of their Junior College prize money to buy these for the kids.
 

 We thank them for their thoughts!
 

 [9 more days to camp!] All items for Goodie Bags for the children in Myanmar are now ready! 
 

 On 25 March 2019 once all volunteers gather at the campsite, we will repack all these items into 250 portions with the drawstring bags as the 'Goodie Bag' itself. We will then distribute them to all children once the camp starts! 
 

 We look forward to sharing more action photos on the actual day!

110,2019,GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 52nd month since Nov 2014,Necessities,Rice for Hope,"GVH 'Rice for Hope' Initiative is now into our 52nd month since Nov 2014! In March 2019, 42 sacks of rice are distributed to 16 homes for children and widows and 15 packets of milk powder + 5 tins of Baby Food to an orphan baby in Bawathit Children Home. Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in March 2019. Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks Mother Bosom: 4 sacks Lawknu Home: 1 sack Bethel Home: 3 sacks Widow Home: 2 sacks Love & Mercy: 3 sacks Lighthouse Home: 4 sacks Grace Home: 2 sacks Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 3 sacks Faith Home: 2 sacks Noble Home: 2 sacks Canaan Home: 2 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 2 sacks + 15 pkts of milk powder + 5 tins of baby food Background Information: These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas. Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables. We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet. While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved. Since Nov 2014, a total of 1515 sacks of rice, 65 packets of milk powder and 5 tins of baby food have been contributed by kind donors. The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint: Crown Orphanage: 154 sacks Ebenezer Home: 158 sacks Mother Bosom: 151 sacks Grace Home: 79 sacks Canaan Home: 108 sacks Faith Home: 102 sacks Lawknu Home: 82 sacks Boarding School: 2 sacks Widow Homes: 67 sacks Bethel Home: 123 sacks Hope Home: 3 sacks Love & Mercy: 68 sacks Lighthouse Home: 99 sacks Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks Noble Home: 41 sacks Htun (Eagle) Home: 43 sacks Abundant Life Home: 38 sacks Emmenuel Home: 37 sacks GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 13 sacks + 65 pkts of milk powder + 5 tins of baby food Home in Kachin: 2 sacks Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015) Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes) As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible.

112,2019,[18th GVH Water Well Project],Necessities,Water Supply,"Work started this morning as the villagers started the digging process. Soon we will know how deep the well can go. Work is also ongoing now to build a large container on brick and cement as a storage tank for the water. We will share more news once we have successfully reached the underground water source. Reported by Linus and Joseph With Yvonne The GVH Team PS: Somehow we can't upload both video and photo in the same FB post now. As such, the photos are added at the back of this video. So do watch this video all the way till the end :)
 

 Our exploration brought us to this place called BotelGone Village Primary School and it's surrounding villages where we realised that they are facing difficulties in gaining access to clean water especially during the 4-month dry summer season from March - June. The project involved building a deep mechanical well in the school premise with the understanding that the school will share water from the new well to the villagers staying nearby. The school will protect and maintain the well as well as to cover the running cost of the well which is mainly the cost of electricity for the machine pump to work. The video Montage also shows a metallic water container donated by an NGO. However, the local villagers will need to fill up the tank by themselves. There is no other significant help offered to this school and village from other NGO according to the local villagers. The school actually has an existing water well (as shown in the photo). However, the water well when built many years ago and was not deep enough. As such, the villagers shared that during the 4-month dry season, the water well will be dried and the water quality is also not very clean during the rainy season. Villagers staying nearby either do not have their own hand pump wells or those who have, will face the same difficulty of dried up wells during the 4-month summer season. All these while, the villagers managed to survive by visiting a monastery a distance away to fetch water. Supply of water there is also not consistent. Some villagers will visit other villagers' homes asking if their well can still pump water during the dry season. If so, they will get water from them. Although life is not easy to get water, they somehow manage to live by. This 300 feet mechanical water well which we are building in the school will be the deepest well in that village. The water deep below is expected to be much cleaner than what their manual well pump can extract and water supply can be consistent through the year. The villagers said that they will come together and work out a way to send water from the school to other nearby clusters so the villagers can have access to the cleaner water all year round. This well is expected to serve the community for many years to come. This school currently has 77 kids and a few hundreds families staying nearby. After much interaction with the villagers and some research efforts, we decided to start this project. The water digging is expected to start this coming week. We thank Yvonne for partnering us in this project for the local community of Botel Gone.",BotelGone Village Primary School,"https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/1002331883293242

In February 2019, 47 sacks of rice are distributed to 16 homes for children and widows, 1 primary school and 25 packets of milk powder to an orphan baby in Bawathit Children Home. Here is a summary of where our rice distribution have reached in Feburary 2019. Crown Orphanage: 4 sacks Ebenezer Home: 4 sacks Mother Bosom: 4 sacks Lawknu Home: 1 sack Bethel Home: 3 sacks Widow Home: 2 sacks Love & Mercy: 3 sacks Lighthouse Home: 4 sacks Grace Home: 2 sacks Abundant Life Home: 2 sacks Emmenuel Home: 2 sacks Htun Htun (eagle) Home: 2 sacks Faith Home: 3 sacks Noble Home: 3 sacks Canaan Home: 2 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 2 sacks + 25 pkts of milk powder Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (as study excellence prizes) Background Information: These home which we sponsor Rice are not official nor institutionalised orphanages. They belong to ordinary village dwellers who took pity for the needy children they come across (either on the street or brought to them from religious bodies or relatives from their far-northern tribes due to push factors like poverty, war, natural disasters) and decided to provide them with shelter, food, clothing and an opportunity to attend public school nearer to Yangon area which is believed to have better educational system than in the Northern areas. Generally, such homes of about 12 - 15 children consume about 4 sacks of rice a month and each sack of rice weighs about 50kg. As children and widows eat meat 1 - 3 times a month, rice makes up the bulk of your daily food intake together with vegetables. We sponsor them with rice so as to lighten the load of the caregivers who are barely making ends meet. While price of rice may change from time to time due to market fluctuation, we currently collect a flat rate of S$35 per sack of rice which will cover logistics and operational cost involved. Since Nov 2014, a total of 1473 sacks of rice and 50 packets of milk powder have been contributed by kind donors. The following is the updated all-time tally of our footprint: Crown Orphanage: 150 sacks Ebenezer Home: 154 sacks Mother Bosom: 147 sacks Grace Home: 77 sacks Canaan Home: 106 sacks Faith Home: 100 sacks Lawknu Home: 81 sacks Boarding School: 2 sacks Widow Homes: 65 sacks Bethel Home: 120 sacks Hope Home: 3 sacks Love & Mercy: 65 sacks Lighthouse Home: 95 sacks Bethlehem Home: 66 sacks Noble Home: 39 sacks Htun (Eagle) Home: 40 sacks Abundant Life Home: 36 sacks Emmenuel Home: 35 sacks GaYuNa Home: 13 sacks Bawahthit Children Home: 11 sacks + 50 pkts of milk powder Home in Kachin: 2 sacks Garuna Orphanage: 1 sack Zui Tui Village: 31 sacks Za Lun Village: 30 sacks (flood relief 2015) Ping Neal Gone School: 4 sacks (Study Excellence Prizes) As we contribute rice, we are constantly moving towards helping these homes become more self-sustainable so that their dependent on donation aids will be reduced to the minimum possible. As we tend towards this goal, donation of rice can help solve the immediate problem of operational deficit of these homes, which are mainly started by people with great hearts for the needy children as well as the helpless widows and who decided to keep them without much considering whether it is actually sustainable for their family to do so. Such commendable quality of others before self deserve help from us who may have a little more to share. Thank you for supporting our 'Rice for Hope' initiative. We hope you enjoy the new graphics we have put up to showcase our collective effort to share the joy of giving.","Crown Orphanage

114,2019,Prize giving ceremony,Education,Academic Education,"Today we congratulate 28 students from Ping Neal Gone School of Hmawbi Township for attaining academic excellence and being recognised for excellent study attitude during their annual prize giving ceremony.
 

 As a form of encouragement, we sponsored 200kg of rice as prizes for the awardees in hope that this practical award would carry a subtle message to the community that an educated child can support and feed his family and even his village in future.
 

 We are honoured to be invited to attend the prize giving ceremony and given a chance to deliver a speech to the audience. Project Director, Joseph, represented GVH and delivered his words of encouragement to the student population and their parents.
 

 In his speech, he shared his personal educational journey coming from a village that has (and still has) no elementary school. He recalled the days he had to travel 4 hours daily between his village and the middle school for 4 years before studying in a high school while staying in an orphanage. He eventually got a scholarship to complete his university education while working full time. 
 

 He emphasised the importance of education and good character and that the meals on the table can be more easily materialised when they study hard enough to attain a good enough academic qualification or a useful enough skills to create value to society in exchange for a fair remuneration. 
 

 We are glad to be able to work with the head master and teachers of Ping Neal Gone School over the past 2 years in their tireless effort to lead these elementary students to progress in their educational journey.",Ping Neal Gone School of Hmawbi Township,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/984877471705350,,,,,,

 We will continue to work with the villagers to further improve the wells and will share more details once we have achieve a significant milestone. 
 

 Once again, a big thank to our sponsor, Ida Widjaja for partnering with us in this project.
 

 we are glad to share that we have reached clean water at about 100 feet underground for both water well as of today. 
 

 The local villagers came together and set up a temporary cooking area to prepare food for the workers too!
 

 Our exploration brought us to this village in the northern outskirts of Yangon called Wanet Chaung Village. 
 

 After our assessment and interaction with the local villagers, we realised that the village cluster of 25 families, does not have access to clean water. We believe the addition of 2 water wells will significantly improve their living condition by bringing clear water more accessible to them.
 

 Although the villagers are not financially capapble to afford a water well for themselves, they are willing to contribute to this project in terms of manpower and building of structures to work with this water well.
 

 The 17th GVH Water Well Project is now underway and the digging work has started to build 2 manual water wells for this village. We look forward to share the next milestone soon!

121,2019,Water well,Necessities,Water Supply,"A great start to 2019 for the villagers of Myoe Shung Lan Village as the water well is now fully functional after a week of waiting! 
 

 Today, we managed to resolve an issue with the pumping mechanism. As the water reservoir underground was deeper than expected, the pumping pressure required was higher than what a hand pump can produce. After much consideration and discussion with the local villagers, we concluded that the only way to resolve this problem is to install a small machine pump that runs on diesel instead. 
 

 As a diesel-powered pump will incur daily running cost to operate it, the villagers come to a consensus that they will pool money together (about $0.10 - $0.20 each) to pay for the daily running cost of the pump so that they can all have convenient access to useable underground water instead of continuing to walk 30 minutes 2-way to the next nearest water source.
 

 This small pumping issue has unexpectedly fostered community spirit in Myoe Shung Lan Village where people come together to solve an issue so everyone can move ahead for a slightly better life collectively.
 

 We are also heartened by the responsibility displayed by the Uncle of village who took ownership of the water well project and the initiative he took to move the project forward and in uniting the villagers. 
 

 The villagers have shown us that if everyone is willing to put in a little each, they can collectively progress for the better. 
 

 This turns out to be a very special project indeed!
 

 We are now in the last step of the project. The villagers will be building a fence themselves for water well and also a simple water container using ground sheets.

 This village consist of about 100 families which depends on a nearby concrete holes for fetching water for their daily use like washing and bathing. The concrete hole was initially constructed not meant to be a water catchment area. It was built as part of a construction project with a tunnel meant to drain water away. However, by chance, the structure was able to hold water and the local people shared that water was relatively clean last year especially during the summer season. However, as more and more construction is going on nearby, the quality of the water dwindled and it became very muddy. Local children like to catch fishes in this water hole and some like to jump into it to swim. Today, the water can't be used for consumption.",,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/703151523211281?__xts__[0]=68.ARDNXHlHb6n1ONelbDGIIA__IObtqfFBX0JQoT6z0ulbPAbS0P_QOVEPaPeV6Zs2p4o8ER7gND_8h6DLdeezMswdLbhOor3fAbBNRI8QNYHZ9o3i8-bmG3E3E71FlvqS0DqXewbbWZyrHKt6G6WMFTfpUlySlLrqWyePfxx1I-2Sn8kxczRnyJgJctDlzA0DcA3-5sM4vyJKDDID_HDNlWaEJX51k2HVbbI8bbkMMPn-E2BaJPkg0AqifC9o596Ykt4OW6I3KVsOkD9rzJONmAFWg2HLT5RG8NB4KLwEKWyqIQcoNs5UQ3O6doXx3PbNgx5ouJKqVFlH7SQwcDbarX0,,,,,,

 Additionally, we bought some cement and made a base beside the 2 water wells. This will help the villages place their pails on to collect the extracted water and make washing more easier.
 After a few days, we have assessed the performance of the 2 new manual water wells built for Yuzana Village. We are happy to share that one of the wells extracts fresh enough water for drinking while the other, which extracts slightly salty water, will only be used for washing and cleaning for the time being until we have explored a feasible way to filter the water extracted.",Yuzana Village,"https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/652525098273924?__xts__[0]=68.ARAqjofj-AKWObpmBpDOjEz4WxcoSFhrc-Z8rkow5vWemSYOJt8PEMdhTXPjmurJovYdIg27HwOk4-4k0w9K2MBKlVyABu7-6kIG6JBNGUyqU5rW0KHa07lAyJYbA1_f9Hx424WjuzLvaFVxqWnUEWAbeRcrkQ1x6tUWf4Ca2TeE8QmRPLmpDQUKfp4lcal7bbZGvSVCl2bp3UtMHBEEiviROoyPLDwkaDIx1z0yhZthsd8PbdFeg_5Gp3sQSDKFTNrzFBUhFP7_ncwzg8RMah3iIiEha3vyljNyDOT7k3E4U3R-yn1Z5DFSmIdrr5SHKi98JNaVxN_M5qSfodCcCxg

357,2016,Update of Mushroom Farm (2nd Cycle) in collaboration with Crown Orphanage.,Sustainability,Enterprise,"We had our first cycle between Sept 2015 and Nov 2015 during the rainy season which generated about 60% profits as shared in our earlier post. With the help from Mr Max Chua and friends, who supported the upgrade of the roof of the farm in hope that a darker and well covered environment would help increase yield, performance of the 2nd cycle was disappointing as shared by PH Moses, the founder of the Home.
 He believe that as the 2nd cycle was between Dec 2015 and Feb 2016 during the cold ""Winter"" season, the natural environment was much dryer than the earlier round. Much of the mushroom harvested had also dried up as a consequence. The 2nd cycle recorded a loss of about 35% from the cost of the spore bags.
 The 3rd cycle has just started in April 2016 with the donors of GVH sponsoring 650 spore bags of the 1300 spore bags to be planted as committed by the Home.

In July - Sept 2015, as Myanmar was hit by one of the worst storm in history, landslide has caused part of the road to be covered by soil and mud from the top. This 'After' photo is taken during the dry season in Nov 2015. It is indeed a discouraging scene.
 The purpose of the road widening project was that it could improve the accessibility between the town and the village so that there could be easier access to medical facilities, schools, food, building materials with the goal of improving the lives and even income potential of the village through tourism. Thus the road was purposely widened from the then single bike trail to a road wide enough for a car to travel up and down the mountain.
 After the disaster, part of the road is now reduced to even less than a bike trail width as experienced by Linus, Michael Chan and Brandon Boo during their last adventure up the mountain in the wet season in July 2015.","mountain top village, Zui Tui, to the town of Mindat",https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/437152103144559,,,,,21.3711229,93.9504002
386,2015,Involvement of local people for water well projects,Necessities,Water Supply,"Why are these water well destroyed? Hard lesson learnt about philanthropic work in Myanmar. We visited a site where a team from a foreign NGO constructed several water wells for the villagers. Now they are mainly destroyed. No water comes out when we tried to pump water. Levers and movable parts were stolen. Nuts removed. Even metallic parts were cracked. Those that still work provide yellowish water unsuitable for drinking.
 After some research, we realised that the NGO merely came into the village, picked a spot and spend their budget on the construction work. After the project is completed, there is no longer any follow up work done and nobody in the village is responsible for these 'donated' wells. Moreover, we believe that not much effort was put in to determine the feasibility of the project location and to carefully consider it's long term sustainability. It appears to have been a ""just-want-to-get-the-job-done"" attitude. 
 To minimise the chance of this from happening contributors should get the local community to play a part in these projects and ensure that someone in the village with a kind heart is willing to take on responsibility for the well being built. If not, it would be better not to start the project at all. Moreover, all projects meant to benefit the needy community should ideally be carried out only if there is a long term sustainability in mind or the projects should be such that the local community can eventually fend for themselves. Doing just a one off project thinking that it will solve a long term issue rarely works. In some cases, it could even discourage the local community from working hard for themselves thinking that aids will always come. Giving money does not solve long term poverty. We need the involvement of the local people.
 If not, we would rather walk away.",,https://www.facebook.com/globalvillageforhope/posts/436024456590657,,,,,,

432,2015,"Brief story of this student, Zaw Mar Wu",Miscellanous,Brief story of student,"The brief story of this student, Zaw Mar Wu and how we might lend her a hand for her better future. For years, Wu left her hometown of Northern Myanmar to stay in New Generation Orphanage in hope for better education.Her ambition is to be a doctor so as to help people who are suffering from depression and ill-health just like herself. She also wants to earn lots of money and contributes back to her family and village which are currently affected by religious conflict. To do so, she needs to pass her Grade 11 High School exam to gain entrance into a university. Unfortunately, the 17-year-old girl failed the last high school exam despite studying hard for it. The orphanage was also shocked by the result as Wu is the brightest and most hardworking student there. In fact, for 5 years, none of the grade 11 students of this orphanage passed High school too.
 

 It was puzzling to me and so I decided to find out more from her in person on my last visit there and these were the challenges faced by her.
 

 1) Due to lack of financial support, Wu wasn't able to have proper and consistent tuition. It is a culture there that students without tuition is very unlikely to keep up with the pace and will be at an disadvantage.
 

 2) Nobody in the orphanage is able to teach Grade 11 student.
 

 3) 3 months before the exam, the orphanage managed to sign her up to an inexpensive classroom based tuition centre but the distance is far away and Wu had to travel on foot to and from the centre everyday for an hour each way, and things get worse on rainy days. 
 

 4) Couple with her already weak body, Wu fell ill a month leading to the exam but still have to continue to travel to and from the tuition centre daily.
 

 5) When back to hostel, she typically lost her appetite and hardly eat much which further deteriorated her health. 
 

 6) She suffers from depression and wasn't able to cope with the mounting stress and even expectation from the people around her.
 

 7) She felt home-sick often and she only has chance to speak to her family once a month at most.
 

 8) Her study environment in the orphanage was not conducive and with much noise around, she had difficulty focusing.
 

 During the meeting, I shared with her my thoughts about her situation and encouraged her that in order for her to be a great doctor in future who gives hope to others, she should start to learn to be help herself from now.
 

 She will be re-taking her High School Exam again next year for one more time. 
 

 In Myanmar, In order for one to have a better life, passing high school and university is of utmost importance. Those who failed high school (which is up to 70% of cohort failed) ends up working as hard labour, general worker with low paying jobs (US$50/mth) and even farmers back to their hometown. Passing rate of students from villages are much lower than those from the city mainly due to income gap and opportunity gap.
 

 Her next high school exam will be in March 2016.
 

 To me, she is someone who is willing to and will work hard. Her progress is just obstructed by some external factors which can be solved by us. I am determined to lend her a hand with GVH by providing her with better study environment, study material and also to support her tuition for the next 8 months to hire someone who can teach her at the orphanage daily in a effort to set her mind focused. I will explore possibility to provide her with better quality and nutritional food. My brief research revealed that hiring a tutor daily may amount to about US$120/month (rough estimate).",New Generation Orphanage,https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=395423623984074&set=a.376618039197966,,,,,,

Master Explorer, Joseph, despite his illness, made it to the site today to supervise the progress. Fresh water has been reached after 2 days of digging. Next is to lay the pipes and then install the pump follow by the Well. We are excited that after completion, at least 20 families in the premise will be directly benefited. May the lives of the villagers change for the better.
 

 2nd water project research revealed problem that struck the village of Taikkyi. Current situation is that the existing well is a 20 feet well which is only half full despite now being rainy season. In dry season, it's completely dry. Some houses have manual pump about 65 feet deep. Problem is that water coming out is 'milky' as it's not well 'filtrated' underground. In dry season, no water is reached. For those lucky manual pump that can reach clearer water, it's taste salty.
 In dry season, water shortage is a major problem and villagers are forced to walk a far distance to fetch from another catchment area. The government pipes for some reason has not been functional. Water well is empty for government supplied pipes.
 As such, we propose to dig a deep water well powered by fuel or electric.
 Quotation seeking is currently underway.
 LTH eduhub is likely to sponsor this well through its in house donation drive.
